Statistical methods are used and statistics is another area that has no truck with ""truth"" -- it is the mathematics of making your way in a probabilistic universe. Having papers come out with promising claims and having ""only"" 50% of them stand up to professional scrutiny is a wondrous miracle.

I think the bit I was addressing was suggesting a technique to scale selection through automated means by testing against the best. I agree reality is a better test. But you miss the point about simulation. With simulation you can - test/be tested/train in compressed time - test/be tested/train with different scenarios- test/be tested/train individual components of the process- test/be tested/train with lower costs - test/be tested/train in controlled circumstances to allow better measurement<i>'... having done something is better than simulating it ...'</i>Pilots fly planes but they also train and test their skills in simulation due to cost, risk and a lot of other factors. People who do things, need ways to test their skills, improve and be tested. Why not startups? In the case of YC,  'done', 'doing' may not be controlled enough to measure against the best (conjecture).

If Sequoia have a wonderful track record for picking winners, I offered another means of calculating the value of the stock based on the likelihood there would be a liquidity event.Here's something to ponder: if the industry gets 20% and Seqouia gets 22% of their investments to a liquidity event, Seqouia is doing fantastically well. 10% better!But: how much does a 2% difference in likelihood affect the value of the stock for employees?Feel free to plug in Sequoia's actual numbers.

But my post wasn't about investing, it was about valuing stock options so you could understand what they are worth on a risk-adjusted basis.What's the difference?Remember, when you invest alongside them you get all sorts of extra rights like double dips, convertible shares, preferred, and a zillion other ways to get money in situations at the expense of founders.This is why it is very important not to assume that just because a name brand VC invests in a company that employee options or founder shares are somehow worth as much as you might pay for those same shares if you are the same VC.If anything, employee options are worth much, much less, because VCs can get some of their money back if there is a modest wind-up or merger, whereas employees only cash out if there is a major event.",1175402122,,comment,,0.02,0.844,0.136,0.9843

She replied that the big three are only able to pursue and develop the projects which show a high margin due to their high operating costs thereby allowing small ventures to flourish in projects that aren't 'profitable enough'.Certainly this argument has also been made for the internet market too, but the oil and gas market is heavily capital dependent with large 'retooling' costs whereas the internet industry is driven largely by a smart labor force (ie: a more agile industry).

Our family life was happiest during the building phase of the company - before success was surely won. One thing I'm sure of is that my dad would have been miserable if he had a straight job and that would have affected our family a lot more than material instability. There are many lessons that you can teach a child about resilience - about fortune's ups and downs and how to handle risk that are unavailable to those who put their lives on hold to rear a child. I wouldn't have had any other childhood. We had extreme fortune upheavals. At one point, the family lost everything. But dad started again and made a success.

We went through the start-up stage with another business before we had children, but we won't think of postponing this start-up because of our kids. It is hard work to combine starting up and parenting, but being parents while working a traditional 9-to-5 is hard work, too. We have found that we are happier when we are being creative on our own, regardless of income level. When we're happy, the kids are happy, too.They have adapted well to everything we've thrown at them so far. And we are encouraged by their go-with-the-flow attitude.In the end we want them to understand that you make your own life. The best way we can teach them this is to actually do so ourselves....and that's what we are doing.Sounds like that's what you are doing, too.

This was the summer of 2000, at the height of the dot-com boom.  The NASDAQ had just peaked, but nobody knew it yet.We got picked up first by the local community newspapers, then the Boston Herald, then the local TV news.  Then we ran out of funding, but we continued getting press inquiries for several months after we were technically out of business.  We had a $20k PR budget (which we inflated to $50k whenever we talked to people), but we never spent any of it.  Instead, our (18 year old) PR guy would just cold call newspaper editors with ""Hi, this is Trip Guray, I'm at an all-teenage startup called inAsphere.com, and we have a story you might be interested in.""  If they weren't interested, fine, we'd say thanks for your time and try someone else.  If they were, we'd send them a press release over e-mail or arrange for an interview.Press coverage tends to snowball: if you get a story published in a community newspaper, you're much more likely to get picked up by a major metropolitan newspaper.

Maybe I'm just thinking too far ahead, but the same goes for dates that I go on. Dumb clueless girls actually turn me off (even if pretty). My friends think I am kidding when I say I am attracted to women a little older than me because they assume I am a gold-digger. But I'm not, I just like their maturity over girls my age.Anyway, for the longest time, I couldn't really describe, I didn't have any solid metrics on how to explain to a friend, why I think a girl is mature/inmature. It's not about the age. I think your point about pulling the ""I'm just a kid"" card totally makes sense. Kids tend to wait for something to happen (reactive) -- wait for their mom/dad/boss to tell them to do something, they need to be prodded, at which they will say ""do I really need to brush my teeth now?"" and groan. Adults are they ones who anticipate the next move, planning the strategy of where to go next, looking out for potential pitfalls and coming up with ideas of mitigating (proactive).I guess I just am attracted to driven people, and dislike pessimists. I've seen plenty of people in college and in corporate who pessimists/downers like that, because they can't come up with new ideas/strategies. So by shooting at ideas of their peers, and bringing their peers down to their level -- they get to maintain the status-quo.

BitGeek,,,,8071,,8001.0,1525543161,,"Older programmers are more productive than younger programmers.   I think the perception that goes the other way is based on teh confusion of measurements of productivity.Zuckerman measurs productivity as lines of code generated, or worse, new classes generated.   Kapor (I presume) would measure productivity as number and difficulty of new features correctly implemented.It seems that in the late 1990s, and since, the number of ""programmers"" who are not hackers has risen dramatically.  Hackers started programming at 12 because they were technophiles.I have actually worked with a jock ""programmer"" who was proud of the facct that he didn't have a computer at home-- he left all his work at work.  He was an extreme case (And he produced lots of lines of code, but not a lot of functionality)... but the trend seems clearly there.Apparently programming has become a prestigous career- and this has led to the rise of defensive tecniques like unit tests, and otherwise organizing projects around the assumption that your ""engineers"" are idiots. FWIW, all the job adverts that say ""Rockstar"" or ""superstar"" or ""coder"" in them - I immediately filter out because I assume they were written by someone who had no clue what a strong engineer looks like.  No engineer worth their salt wants to be called a ""Coder""- this is a derogatory term.  Hacker is the word that they really should use, but the people who say ""rockstart"" are people who do not know that ""hacker"" means something other than one who breaks security on systems.I see the word ""rockstar"" and I immediately know they are looking for someone with lower skill than I have.   This is not arrogance-- its just experience with HR types.

But then I started working at a 10,000 person company and began to realize we weren't all that after all, the real Peter Framptons were the ones innovating at big companies. You build something brilliant while simultaneously serving literally billions of customers? Party on, you TRULY rock. ...'</i> [2]So this is what Fake is up to.

whacked_new,,,,8111,,8110.0,1525543168,,"Here are some thoughts I have regarding popularity meters on news sites and such. Maybe some people would find it interesting or possibly useful. I would also love to hear other opinions, so do share.I am sure many readers here have seen the new SlashRating box, which sports digg-esque (generally speaking) number ratings for each article. Maybe you noticed that the Gmail Paper article (<a href=""http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)"">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)</a> and the X-Files article right after it (<a href=""http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)"">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)</a> have substantially different SlashRatings (1000x+ difference). Humor aside, they may both be valid ratings. Readers familiar with digg (easy example) have seen ratings ranging from the single digits, to way through the thousands. I believe there is a limit to the informativeness of the number rating. And while many services have jumped onto using similar number-based displays of popularity, here I make a case for the relative measure.As a passer-by, casual reader on digg (which is most readers), when you see a page full of ratings in the hundereds, you probably process only two things from the score: the digit length and leftmost digit. When a 1000+ rating appears, you immediately know from the digit length that it is a magnitude more popular. More than what? More than the surrounding articles. Naturally, your eyes will notice the highest ratings within the page. If you reach a page full of articles rated in the thousands, readers probably apply the same strategy: scan the digit length and the leftmost digit. Unless two or more articles are rated on a higher order of magnitude than the rest, readers would likely ignore the less significant digits -- and when such a comparison is required, the articles are probably popular enough that you read them all.After you mentally shift to a scale of comparison, you ignore details on other orders of magnitude; this is, for example, how your eyes adjust to consistently bright, or dark, environments. Of course numbers are easy to output and fast to read, and details may be interesting and important to the developers, but for browsing efficiency, most readers do not care, nor need to know, if something is rated 4903, or 4692, points, as long as a reference exists for comparison. And this reference will always depend on the number of participating users at a given moment. A better system should thus display only a relative measurement of popularity within a given timeframe. This idea is not necessarily new, but I believe it is definitely a better approach to popularity measurements, and moreso if you are expecting your project to eventually support a large votership.An existing example to illustrate good use of this is something like a community download site. Say something is ""popular"" when over 50% of the users download it. It makes more sense then, to just write ""popular"" when total_downloads / total_users  0.5, rather than showing ""1,040 downloads!"", or even ""5,503,395 downloads!"" (okay, millions is different... but if your users were, like, ants, big deal). In the end, ""popularity"" is a relative measure.I'm sure many folks here have thoughts on related issues; let's hear them :)",1175483202,,comment,,0.013,0.845,0.142,0.9957

Afterall, they are simply trying to satisfy the users constant demands. So eventhough this mental toxin often makes us feel miserable, it is preferable by consumers over having less choice. And this fascinates me.I am contemplating writing an article about choice and relating it to Web 2.0. Here is an excerpt from another article I wrote that relates to this: ""...if a choice is present, perfectionists spend a ridiculous amount of time over simple decisions. Such is the mentality governing users of today's social networks. We are caught up in a web of choices; indeed, the core reason behind MySpace's success is that users rule. MySpace might suck, but it gives its users ample of choice.

dcostolo,,,,8217,,8157.0,1525543183,,"Brett, I've seen participation and preference multiples in term sheets from Tier 1 investors. It all depends on the deal, the stage, and the environment. It's definitely not a bad sign for an entrepreneur, it's just all dependent on what kind of market you're in and what the demand for the deal is from other investors. Having said this, participation was classicly an ""east coast"" deal term so you'd probably still expect to see it more from new york/boston investors than from west coast investors. I think that's still accurate.

The two-term formula was obtained by classifying the almost-injective functions using a regular grammar; the closed term arose from a sub-language closed under concatenation. Computer experiments suggest that a class of enumeration problems arising from regular monoids have closed form hypergeometric enumeration formulas. Finding an algorithm for computing closed forms of indefinite binomial coefficient sums was an open problem in Knuth's Art of Programming; it was solved by Wilf and Zeilberger. In the example I considered, there is no closed form solution; however there is a way of finding a  decomposition of the sum with good properties. Finding the asymptotically significant term required an idea: the point is that the algorithms I used don't help you find this. One of those algorithms I used was due to R. W.

He didn't say they are overrated.

We do believe that somewhere down the road we may come up with some new tool or way of doing things that is patentable (heck, if Amazon can do it with ""1-click""...) and will pursue that as it comes up.In the larger picture, though, I don't think that this is going to make or break anybody. I went to a workshop a few weeks ago that was hosted by the Stern School of Business - they had a panel of VCs and one Angel Investor, a startup business pitching to them, and an audience full of people able to ask questions. What was interesting was that one of the first questions the VCs asked after the pitch was ""do you have any patents?"" The answer was a pretty straight-forward ""no."" BUT, when asked about it later by someone in the audience, all of the VCs agreed that they didn't really care that the team didn't have anything patented - that they'd rather see a startup spending their time and energy on implementation than on developing a patent portfolio. Really, they just asked the question because they HAVE to ask the question.I think the larger question here is ""why can't someone else do what you're doing?"" and the ""do you have any patents?"" question is the first logical step in answering that. But it's not the end-all be-all. I'm pretty sure Amazon's success really has very little to do with ""1-click"" and that this wan't even patented until a couple of years ago.

- an actor's face could go to the wiki or imdb entry. 
- might be an interesting way to take brand awareness advertising (product placement) and make some conversions to actual purchases.

Law is sometimes nothing more than very expensive bullying.The whole process is designed to be something like a race. Publish a paper about it or article and don't patent it on time? Tough luck! Your own damn article prevents your patent since it's ""prior work."" What constitutes patent infringement, anyway? Alexander Graham Bell wrote a patent at the time that covered just about any form of communication through an electric wire. Would a keyboard be infringing? A completed patent is still not sure proof of ""ownership"" - every patent's fate is ultimately uncertain until you really duke it out in court. They're also incredibly expensive things as well, especially for someone with just a great idea and not enough cash - $10k+ minimum, since patent applications are such complicated things and the USPTO sure likes to take its sweet time. Why not attempt trade secrets instead? If you have a really amazing, great idea to patent, something that ""improves the sciences"" like they're always harping about in patent law, then sure, go for it.

Affiliate links for online shops and such. You can do things like pitch a free magazine subscription offer at users. Those affiliate programs can pay $5 per action.

But during winter and summer breaks, there is not much difference...I love to learn and would love to continue school, but in a sense, it restricts you to its curriculum.

It all came down to three things:1. We wanted to show potential employers that we were smart enough to get into an elite private college.2. We wanted to show potential employers that we were docile and persistent enough to continue attending said elite private college, even though we had accomplished #1.3. We wanted to get to know lots of other people who were willing to pay $40K/year for the privilege of #1 and #2.Of course, once you get out in the working world and actually get involved in hiring decisions, you quickly learn that there's not <i>that much</i> difference in the quality of education at various universities.  Harvard's classroom instruction is not much better than any other top-tier college, and may actually be worse.  MIT's is probably better, but it's nothing that a couple of guys from UVA (ahem, Reddit) can't pick up in their spare time.Instead, you look at the Education section on a resume because people have already done the hard work for you.  Someone at Harvard painstakingly went through 18 years of that candidate's life and decided that they were good enough for Harvard.  I've got code to write: I don't have time to spend digging through a candidate's background.  If it's good enough for Harvard, it's good enough for me.So, the business idea I came up with was a simple certification program.  We'd look at all your test scores, administer a few additional tests, have you complete a project or two, talk to previous people you've worked with, and generally decide if you're worthy or not.  We'd set the bar high enough that the average Harvard or MIT grad would fail.  And if you pass, we give you a college degree - all without having to put up with the bullshit aspects, like going to classes or forking over a couple hundred dollars.

I'm just glad to see someone might be doing something cool to circumvent the current college standard. As much as i talk about college being a big fat waste of time and money, I generally enjoyed my time spent there. I had an awesome marketing job with one of the greatest companies/brands in the world and made some stellar contacts. It was the job offers halfway through college that showed me that the experience was worth MUCH more than the diploma. Finding out that jobs that ""require"" college degrees really just require proof that you are capable and determined was a great realization. If you can demonstrate to a company that you have what it takes, waiting for you to finish your degree could be a waste of time for all parties involved. So if your goal is to get a good job... it is entirely possible without a degree. Your friends and family may tell you otherwise, and very few people will encourage you to drop out to take a job... but it's your decision. Having a degree hardly dictates your happiness or success as a person. I ended up leaving school after 3.5 years. Not to take a job, just because it was clearly a waste of my time. I wanted to focus on starting/building my company, and school was just getting in the way of that. Incidentally I found (sorta like Seth) a way that I could get my last semester's worth of credits from my university - so i'll still have that ""all mighty piece of paper"" in a couple months.My suggestion to people usually is: Do what you want! Fitting the social norm is easy and will probably work out for you, but it might not be the best choice. If I were to go to college again, I'd study something that interested me as a person. Not something that I felt was a happy medium between interesting and a safe career path. <i></i><i></i><i>
You should go to college to learn about something you think is cool & enjoy your time spent there. Study art or music, history of physics... something that will make you want to attend early morning class discussions. Get involved on campus, network with people, and use your free-time to read and figure out how you're going to make your mark. If you're just going to school to prepare for a job... rethink why you'd spend your time and money being lectured and quizzed on material from drab books who's curriculum is behind the times anyway. If you are planning to start a company, you'll know for yourself if college is important to you or not. ",1175634925,,comment,,0.031,0.81,0.159,0.9956

At one job I had been with for several years, my immediate manager left, and the feel of the department went with him.

I think the key, like so many things, is communication. Firmly explain that you're leaving, but that you want to make the transition as easy as possible.Spent time documenting everything you do, to help provide transition documents for your replacement(s).Finally, after leaving, stay in contact with any people from your previous job you got along with- These people will be ideal contacts later in life.

A college degree is not supposed to just be a certification that you are competent over a certain domain of facts, but rather an indication that you have spent 3-4 years thinking, applying yourself, and growing intellectually.While autodidactism is certainly laudable, there is value in a corporate educational setting, namely the value of intellectual interaction.  College is not so much about learning a set of data, but learning how to learn.  (For the ultimate example, consider the Ph.D., a degree meant only to teach you to do research, and requiring legitimate research to attain it.)Now, I'll admit, I was educated in a liberal arts[1] high school, and am currently pursuing a couple of liberal arts degrees.  That is both why and because I believe education is about thinking, not committing facts to memory.  I eschew academic engineering because it is (at my university, at least) primarily a series of courses that certify your knowledge of yet another parcel of facts.  That is useless, educationally.  As technical training,[2] great, but it's not education.Your list of ""why""s implies that, substantively, you were no different at the end of college than at the beginning, modulo a group of friends, and four years aging.  If that is the case, I'm terribly sorry; you managed to miss most of your education.[0] Mea culpa: this entire comment is a bit hot-headed.  You've hit a pet peeve.
[1] Before you jump to conclusions:  the liberal arts include the hard sciences.
[2] In all honesty, that's what engineering school is: a vocational education in an incredibly advanced vocation.

Short answer, yes.First, the way things are structured tax-wise, C corporations get to deduct founder health insurance 100%, so that's the most tax-advantaged scenario.  If you pay for your own personal health insurance or do it as a sole proprietorship, etc. you're basically getting a raw deal from Congress.I'm in California, where basically any 2+ person small business that's been around about like 3-6 months is guaranteed group health insurance for its employees at no more than 10% over an index that represents what bigger companies pay.  It's a sweet deal.  So if you're in California and are going to go this route, you may want to incorporate ahead of time to start that clock ticking.So basically the company pays for the insurance for the founders, even though they're not drawing a salary.

You learn how to learn by butting your head up against a problem, reading everything you can about what other people have already done on the problem, trying different approaches until one works, and moving on to the next problem.  After you've repeated this a few hundred times, you start figuring out which approaches are likely to work and which aren't.The Ph.D is a good example.  There are plenty of people that are ""ABD"" (All But Dissertation) - they've gone through all the coursework, been taught all that their instructors can teach them, but nobody considers them ""real"" Ph.Ds.  Why?  Because the meat of a Ph.D program is actually going out and <i>doing original research</i>, and someone who hasn't done the research doesn't really know how to do the research.The point of a certification program is to decouple the act of learning from the act of judging how much has been learned.

Many people who are currently students may be able to use this, and have their coverage be at no or very low cost.For those people who don't qualify, As on May 1st there's a new program, Common Choice, which will be a private-public partnership, to try to bring 4 or 5 low-cost health care plans to everyone.

Leonidas,,,,8806,[8819],8703.0,1525543272,,"Actually, health insurance is an important factor.  If you catch pneumonia or the flu, you're looking at getting knocked out for 2 months (pneumonia resulting from a ""cold"" that was not properly handled), 2 weeks (flu) without medical intervention.  Personally, I'd rather take some meds and be back on my feet in 3-5 days than not be able to afford to see a doc or take some meds....putting my startup behind which would kill me more than an illness.  Without insurance you're looking at least $110 for per doctor visit and about $90 bucks and up depending on what meds you need (PER prescription). Or let's say you broke your arm or leg because you tripped on your shoe laces while walking down the stairs of the Y Combinator building.   Without insurance you're looking at about $2500 and up to get it fixed and that doesn't include the cost of seeing a doctor added into it.Paying $120 bucks a month to cover potential injuries or finding affordable medical insurance and covering yourself for potential injuries is a definitely an important factor not only for yourself, your company, but also to prevent you from getting your co-founders sick.  It is true that if you're younger you are less likely to get sick.  However, if you are under a substantial amount of stress, your immune defense will drop and your chances of getting sick increases.  That's why you see a lot of people get sick during mid terms and exams.So for all of you who are in a startup, I suggest you get at least 1000-2000mg of Vitamin C.

If you go to a ""doctor's office"" he has the right to deny you services if you can't pay (only for non-emergency incidences).  However, if you are in an extreme emergency such as a heart attack or you're dying, he cannot refuse you his services due to the hippocratic oath.However, doctors in hospitals are different.  If you go to the ER (hospital related) the hospital doctor is REQUIRED to see you by US law...without verification of ability to pay.   For doctors in hospitals, this is a big problem because we cater to a lot of homeless patients who walk out and do not pay...and of course one can't do anything about it since they're homeless.Anywhoo, if you get treated in a HOSPITAL, always request an ITEMIZED list of charges.

Well, not necessarily.  If a number of active users have no incentive to bid anymore, for whatever reason, the market size goes down.  If it drops below a certain critical point, then people may lose faith in the market due to lack of goods and leave the service.  Of course, I feel they're doing an awesome job and I don't expect this to happen.  It's just an example.The best markets are those with the highest number of people <i>wanting to trade</i>.I think that creating virtual economies inside of a product is interesting because you have to create something people want (the startup's product) and then something people want inside the product (virtual goods, which happen to be cute women and men in iminlikewithyou's case).

You are using somebody else for infrastructure and that infrastructure changes/goes away/is suddenly more expensive.  Witness Amazon AWS (which we're using), Google Maps, etc.2.  Your benefactor suddenly decides to compete with you.  That happened to a company named Outlooksoft earlier last year when Microsoft decided to get into the budgeting and planning business.  Outlooksoft had based their product 100% on a Microsoft infrastructure.  They had to scramble to add support for other databases and G/Ls.

Seth? Not sure), who argued that there are really two types of programmers- Problem Solvers, and Cogs.Cogs are the people who can tell you every line of code in a TCP/IP stack, or squeeze amazing performance by reprogramming your server-code in assembler. They're the people you bring in to solve problem foo-""We need a guy who kicks butt in SQL to optimize this thing"" Let's find one.""That's great, and that's amazingly useful.. But not for the first few people for a startup.. For a startup, I'd worry more about coming up with solutions to problems that we have.
Someone who can pick up Lisp or Ruby or (insert language of the week) in a few days more useful in those crucial early weeks than someone who can eek every bit of performance.Focus on the hard stuff first, like building something people actually want to use.

I got the feeling you tried to show too many features too quickly.In general, I have realized it is much better to launch with something that does a few things REALLY well rather than a lot of things with little focus. When you launch with whole lot of features people assume you are competing with the big companies. When you launch small and do it well, it is easier to attract a user-base and THEN keep feeding it more advance features in form of updates.Good luck! Looks slick from the UI.

The second item is somewhat covered in the following pg's essay: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html</a>pg seems to believe offline coverage is somewhat obsolete for online startups. This may or may not apply to you.Another way to think about it is to consider how important is the pr service for your expected outcome.

e1ven,,,,8915,,8891.0,1525543288,,"I have the agree with the developers that this is a Great feature because the user hardly ever notices it, but it greatly improves his experience.Having the color scheme work with your logo is what they called a hygiene factor in business school- You seldom get any  praise or notice for it being there, but you'll LOSE points if the scheme doesn't match..I think this has to do with the fact that most users tend to worry more about content than design-Users think ""I need a logo"", or ""I want a photo of my cat"".. They aren't thinking about Whitespace, or color choices. They're thinking about content. They're thinking about how to add Foo, not how it will look.As a application provider (Like so many of us are or want to be) it's our job to abstract design, and let people focus on content, which what they care about in the first place.
If users aren't going to think about design, but they are going to feel bad if you don't have it, they you have three choices-1) Ignore the problem. This is what MySpace and GeoCities do- They let the user upload whatever they want, no matter how it might look. The users focus on content rather on the looks. They'll complain about it, and you'll ""lose points"" with them, but they get to have all the widgets they want. 2) Force most users to display it your way, or have experts modify it. This is what WordPress, Drupal, and other CMS do. The default templates look decent, and editing them is hard for mere mortals, requiring HTML or Scripting.  Creating new templates may be technically possible, but beyond the scope of most users3) Make the user's content look GOOD. This is what Wufoo does with forms, and Apple's iWeb does for webpages. It lets you add the content, but it adds its own design special-sauce. This is the model that we should be shooting for for our Web Apps. How can we make the User's content look good?

This point is stronger when you have a large readership, and even stronger, when your readership has the ability to talk directly to the author, and perhaps even contribute.The challenge is to be able to accomodate a huge number of these copy editors, who come and go as they please, shout or whisper their preferences, and somehow make the end useful and actually better.",1175734827,,comment,,0.041,0.741,0.217,0.9874

That's my job anyway, and honestly I believe execution is more difficult than having high-level ideas.  In practice, I try and hire people that have blogs wherein they showed knowledge as well as serious and deep thinking about the type of problems I want to hire them to solve. The only person I've ever truly thought did an excellent job I hired this way. I didn't know him. I didn't look at a resume. I had one conversation with him. I just read his blog, and I could tell from his writing that he would do a good job. Actually, his blog was just his fiction writing and he was a UI designer and coder but I could still tell from his thinking. He was so smart--a structured, logical, deep and creative thinker. It was clear to me that he would do a good job. He did. I tend to be a perfectionist, and he was the only person I've ever hired that did a perfect job. I had absolutely no criticisms about him. He always exceeded my expectations. It was amazing. I love working with the best people--nothing is more fun.  If they didn't have a blog, I'd tell them to write down their thoughts every day for a few weeks and then I'd read it. I believe that you can't tell anything about anyone except how they behave over time. People lie and misrepresent themselves. But it's pretty much impossible to misrepresent yourself over a period of time. I might try and give them a few of my problems to work on as well. But, if someone isn't the quickest thinker and can't answer a problem I give them in an hour-long interview I really don't care. What if they're amazing problem solvers but they just take overnight? One of the smartest people I know is like this. With a blog, or writing over time, you also get a sense of how well they can articulate their ideas--if they have amazing ideas but they can't articulate them well, then the quality of their ideas doesn't matter. If for some reason they're terrible writers but still smart, you can just have them create a podcast. If they can't do either, then they can't articulate themselves enough to be useful to a company.Watching their thinking over time, you can see how many ideas they generate, since you don't just want people that will only solve the problems you have. You want people that see things you can't and generate ideas themselves. I don't care about how well people fit in. A start-up isn't a clique of best friends, although you certainly need people that you can be bluntly honest with and can be bluntly honest with you. It's better if you like them, of course, but I'm never trying to build any kind of culture except a culture of excellence--well, excellence on deadline. Another thing I've always wanted to try is just to hire someone for two weeks and give them non-critical tasks to do. I could see if they met deadlines and how they actually worked. The best way of finding out if someone can do something is to watch her do it.

comatose_kid,,,,9058,,8848.0,1525543309,,"Depends.For co-founders, you shouldn't even have to interview.  Find the best people that you have worked with before in school, or on the job.  You can then be assured of their creative and intellectual abilities, as well understanding how you'll work together as a team. For other positions, you're obviously going to want to look for smart people, but a key thing for a small startup is to look for smart people who can do many different things well.  For example, I'd be more inclined to choose a s/w eng who has done well designing a web app, and has designed embedded software for a consumer electronics device than an eng who has worked only on web apps for their entire career.As for the second part of your question, I'd agree with e1ven - neither type of question is key, although they do help establish technical ability & creativity.  But my experience diverges from e1vens' in at least one respect - you don't need to choose between problem solvers and cogs (at least as he has defined them).  I have worked with people who can give you tons of detail on specific technical areas, but can also come up with great solutions outside of their technical domains or pick up language X really quickly.  It's rare, but people that have both qualities certainly exist.",1175745993,,comment,,0.014,0.783,0.202,0.9908

BitGeek,,,,9112,,8858.0,1525543317,,"Isn't that some amazing nerve?  The Rick is offering the founder shares in his own company as compensation for not taking a salary!  The inherent assumption behind this asinine perspective is that ""Preferred"" shares are for VCs only... but the reality is that VCs offer nothing to warrant such preferences.   Everyone who has put sweat equity into the company is just as much an investor, and is generally taking on more risk... but the VC expects to be given preferences because such terms are common, and they are common because too many startups cave because they are addicted to the cash.Love that the liquidation preference is ""only"" 1X.  The reality is that it is screwing over all the other investors in the company by saying that the VC goes to the front of the line, gets all their money back, and <i>then</i> gets the percentage of anything left over comensurate with their percentage ownership of the company.   The implication being that employees have not actually invested in the company and if there's anything left over, then the employees and founders get some. This is particularly insulting given that the liklihood of this preference being relevant is increased by taking VC money-- which in this day and age means forgoing almost certain profitability for a higher risk shot at hitting it out of the ballpark. And the price for putting a bomb under your company and lighting the fuse?  They get to be first in line when it explodes and the company is liquidated for much less than it would have gotten if it was a viable business.An employee that puts in $100k worth of labor a year for five years and gets $50k in salary has invested $250k just as much as an investor who puts in $250k in cash.The arrogance of preferences boggles the mind. Nobody in YC should be looking for this kind of investment.  Stick with angels.  Give everyone common- recognize that investors who are only putting in money are fairly compensated by getting shares at a fair valuation.  If they want liduidation preferences, they should pay for it- and thus be investing at a multiple of the valuation that common gets.VC funding was made obsolete in 2000.

One thing that bugs me about it, however, is that one of the advertisements in favor of starting it is that you can get real, serious, no-kidding hacking done, in at least a quarter of your time, while you aren't running frantic errands. That sounds pretty good to me. However, all the hacking I hear about in relation to startups is either a) UI design (e.g. Wufoo) or b) server scaling. Server scaling is about as boring and unhappy to me as you could get without mandating that it be in Java; UI design is better, but still not appealing.

dageroth,,,,9150,[9208],8804.0,1525543323,,"I don't think that a central authority is necessary for money to work, at least not in form of a monopolist. Actually the current systems are rather unsatisfying because a state can loose its credibility and thus the trust in its curreny quite fast, basically as soon as war looms on the horizon or it becomes apparent that it will default on its debt. In the last 25 years over 87 currencies crashed.
And because of the monopoly of the state on money the whole economy is usually going down along. For my part I would therefore abandon the monetary monopoly of the state and allow competition, allow companies to issue money. When they connect their name to the currency and have no legal power to make their money legal tender they will have a much stronger incentive to provide a good and stable money. Hayek wrote a fascinating treatise on the denationalisation of money, and with the ongoing globalisation sooner or later we will get used to juggle with more than one currency in our pockets. Second Life seems to be a step in the direction that companies start to issue private currencies and when states, especially in the developing countries, will fail to keep their currency stable chances are that they will be replaced by private currencies. Equally interesting and probably easier to believe are gold backed currencies with competing private institutes issuing goldbacked money.Still, its great to see people thinking about money in another way than just how to get it.

These macros give the programmer the power to create entirely new, domain-specific languages without too much difficulty.I am currently a Master's student and I hope to eventually be a founder, and my question is the title of this submission.  I can understand why some people would shy away from Lisp, but I also see how many upcoming programmers appreciate the power of Python and Ruby.

I think that such a language would be perfect for startups.I am a glutton for punishment, so my graduate interests lie in programming languages.  Here at Ohio State University, there is a language called RESOLVE that a lot of students don't like too much (it's built on top of C++ and is much too wordy), but it does have some interesting concepts built-in that I would like to put in a language of my own.  In creating a new language, one of the things that would be first and foremost in my mind would be to ensure it had powerful macro capabilities, so I am interesting to hear your feedback on the viability of a language with powerful macros but fewer parentheses.",1175782297,,comment,,0.053,0.76,0.188,0.9894

You either win a Fellowship, you teach a class, you help a professor with his research, or you do grunt work like grading papers and labs.  In any case, tuition, fees, and 80% of health insurance is covered, in addition to a $1600-1850 per month stipend.  That works out to a respectable $20k/yr.If you do not get a Fellowship, you are expected to perform 20 hours worth of work per week (which you actually receive credit for), in addition to your time spent on classes and on your own independent research.In other words, grad school is more like a low-paying job than a cost.  You could make the case that you could be working a higher-paying job in that time, but then you are missing out on the flexibility of being a Ph.D., which allows the possibility of being a professor or getting hired for a pretty high income.  Additionally, you have the opportunity to leave your mark on the field with your research.Even more interesting is that Ph.D. work could lead you to your startup idea, as you unveil a new use of existing technology or a new approach altogether which leads to a money-making possibility.

Benja,,,,9279,,9236.0,1525543345,,"But, of course, you don't have to have code files full of parens in order to have s-expressions. Alternative syntaxes have never taken hold in the Lisp world, which <i>may</i> mean they just offer nothing to an experienced Lisp hacker, but they're certainly not impossible.You can have user-definable infix operators; Haskell has them and uses them to good effect. (The way Haskell does it, you can't have identifiers composed of both letters and operator characters, which Lisp people like to do, but I think we can safely treat that as a matter of taste.) You pick a symbol, say ~, and assign it a precedence and left- or right-associativity:infixr 3 ~infixl 7 .!.Now (x ~ y .!. z) is parsed as ((~) x ((.!.) y z)), where (~) is the Haskell way of making the ~ operator as a prefix function. Haskell also lets you use a prefix function as an infix operator, by putting backquotes around it.If you want to apply this in Lisp, there is the issue that (foo) means something else than foo; I would like to allow (foo x + bar y) to mean ((+) (foo x) (bar y)), but I wouldn't want (x + y) to mean ((+) (x) (y)). My solution would be that a single value is parsed as just a value, but multiple values next to each other is a function call: (foo x + y) is ((+) (foo x) y), to call y without parameters you have to write (foo x + (y)).This leaves you with the parantheses for control structures and the like. If you like layout-based languages, you can adopt the rule that ""expression + colon + newline + indented expression 1 + indented expression 2 + ..."" is parsed as  ""expression (indented expression 1) (indented expression 2) ..."".Some examples of code from On Lisp formatted like this:<a href=""http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/~benja/2007/layoutedlisp.txt"">http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/~benja/2007/layoutedlisp.txt</a>Of course, it still looks like Lisp, with less parens.",1175792059,,comment,,0.0,0.826,0.174,0.9947

This short, easy read details four essential design principles that will help you consciously communicate better visually.  It's also available on O'Reilly's safari service.. <i>Universal Principles of Design: 100 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach Through Design</i>. This book will help you build your design vocabulary and better understand concepts in design that you likely haven't thought of.  It will help you describe the ways in which this page - <a href=""http://www.sandstromdesign.com/nav.html"">http://www.sandstromdesign.com/nav.html</a> - sucks (it lacks external consistency and it contains interference effects, to begin with).  The book has a great format, describing a topic on one page with visual examples on the following page.  The descriptions are short of enough that you can read them in about 4 minutes.. <a href=""http://www.hallwaytesting.com"">http://www.hallwaytesting.com</a> - this is actually my own site.  You can post your site for usability feedback and give usability feedback.  Live usability tests allow you to get more details, but the users on my site also give valuable feedback, and it doesn't cost you any money or nearly as much time.  I try to give feedback for as many sites as possible and am usually pretty thorough about it. Users have told me that the site has helped them a lot.
=== The Seller ===. <a href=""http://www.marketingexperiments.com"">http://www.marketingexperiments.com</a> . This site is absolutely the best web development resource I've found, ever.  It contains articles on developing a unique value proposition, doing competitive analysis on the Internet, and of course actually marketing your site using PPC, SEO, and other online marketing techniques.  Perhaps the most valuable thing I learned from this site is that online marketing <i>is</i> online testing.. <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>, by Dale Carnegie.  For a long time I didn't want to read this book because I thought doing so would make me a sleaze ball.  Instead it's made me a more effective communicator.  When you think about it, honing our skills in most areas involves learning how to communicate with other humans better.  As The Tech Wizard it's essential that you communicate the purpose of your code.   As The Artist it's essential you communicate the purpose of a site and each of its elements.  As The Seller you must know how to communicate value.  Dale Carnegie's book will show you how to effectively communicate value.

rebecca_d,,,,9300,,6636.0,1525543348,,"These are the precise questions that my startup, Knowitall.tv, is trying to answer. What will advertising look like as video programming and advertising dollars shift to the web? Where are those advertising dollars going to go, who will decide on the content these dollars will fund, and who will provide this content?I think the most important thing Garfield notes in this article is the huge shift in power has occurred with the advent of dvr and web video. People don't have to sit through flashy, in-your-face ads that shout 'buy me!.' These ads can be fast-forwarded or deleted. On the web, the attention span of the viewer is drastically reduced by the sheer volume and choice of content. Why would I watch an ad when I don't have to on this site over here? The audience is no longer captive. The student has become the teacher. We are in charge. Advertising and networks are not doomed in any sense.  However, traditional, 'flashy' ads will have to be replaced by more informative, interactive, gentle, pull advertising content. Think product placement, contests, video games, informational videos... Ad content will also be interactive-the best way to extend the short-attention span of the average web user. Just because networks are reeling in costs does in no way mean that they are 'over.'  
  
Yes, traditional purveyors of advertising and large networks should be concerned, but only if they do not adapt to this huge shift in power. These networks and ad companies became successful because of innovation and I am sure they will temper the storm. However, who should be taking close note of this market shift is ambitious independent producers and content providers. There is a huge gap in the market for a few companies to sneak in and make an absolute killing. To summarize: Because the viewer is in charge, ads in the future will inform rather than entertain, engage rather than impress, so really, the only question to answer is, what do the end users want to know and from whom?
I believe local expertise and endorsement to be the untapped goldmine of this 'new' advertising.",1175795954,,comment,,0.033,0.836,0.13,0.9856

And this program is probably a good one for students who are still in college and want to build a company over the summer. But anyone who has left college and is working for a living should be able to save up one months living expenses every month. (EG: make 25 an hour, gross $4k, $3.6k after taxes, live on $1,500 a month or so.)   Thus if you work for 6 months as a contract programmer (or better yet as an employee for a startup) you will then have 6 months of expenses to build your business.  Thus there's no reason that not getting YC funding should be an impediment to strting a business.The strong impression I get from people who post here, and the people who attented startupschool is that they are focused on getting funding.  They want to go to YC, or move to the bay area for connections to funding.  Landing a VC deal is seen as the end goal.  This is not an entreprenurial focus.  Were you focused on VC funding for viaweb, or were you trying to build a business?The original poster is right-- build a business-- that should be the focus.  Not getting funding.  Not worrying about what you're going to do if you don't get into YC.  YC should be seen as a possible opportunity, but not critical to success. And since YC only happens twice a year and is limited in the number accepted... waiting for the next round of YC indicates that building the business or product is not the number one priority.As an investor, I'd rate highly someone who was living off of their own savings to build their product-- they have shown the gumption and have even more skin in the game.",1175811144,,comment,,0.037,0.874,0.089,0.8

mattjaynes,,,,9440,,9352.0,1525543369,,"Rick Segal's approach seems the most charitable. It works similarly in dating. 
(Note that I date with the goal of marriage in mind - definitely not a player, which makes this a good analogy to the good VC's - they're hoping to 'marry' founders when it's a good match)Many guys burn bridges when they have to break up with a girl. However, that's totally unnecessary! I've certainly done that when I was a teen, but have found the charitable approach much more effective. Let me be clear that 'charitable' does not mean unclear or deceptive in the breakup. On the contrary - it's being very clear and honest about the breakup with the girl. That being said, you <i>do</i> withhold any information that would unnecessarily hurt her (ex: you're not attracted to something about her that she can't help).The breakup needs to establish that:1) the relationship is not a match for you, but that that is no reflection on her personally in the slightest2) you genuinely admire the N number of amazing things about her3) you hope that you both can still be good friends, but that you understand and honor her wish if she thinks it's better not to4) the romantic possibilities of your relationship are just not there sufficient for marriage and never will be (let her move on with closure!) Don't worry, if you change your mind later you can crawl back on your knees to her and tell her you were wrong - but you have to let her go and pursue other possibilities.5) you are open to talk with her about it at any time - this will usually relieve a lot of her anxiety about having to wonder why you broke up later.Note: Be careful about the 'still being friends' thing. If you are hanging out too much with her, most other guys will avoid asking her out - and you don't want to hinder her ability to move on. Be sure to honor her space and let her know that you are doing that so she doesn't feel rejected by it.Success stories:2004 girlfriend: Good breakup, she decided it was better for her to not have contact. I honored that and imagine she has gone on to great things.2005 girlfriend: Good breakup, though we did get back together several times. Ultimately it ended, but our communication was so good that we have remained best friends since then and talk regularly about our new relationships. We both are huge advocates of each other - she sells me to other girls and I sell her to other guys. We do business together too since there is such a high level of trust.2006 girlfriend: Had a great time together, but we both knew it wouldn't work. We had great communication and though it was hard for me to let her go, I did and that really impressed her to the point where we have a similar high-trust, high-advocate relationship as with 2005 girlfriend.2007 girlfriend: Ended about a week ago. So far so good. Very hard for both of us. But we've had good communication since and it is evolving well into a good friend relationship.Note that these tips assume that you are only dating reasonably sane girls - with psycho chics this probably won't apply ;)It's important to remember that going the charitable route is often harder in the short-term than the alternatives, but it's important to suck it up and have the kahoonas to do it right. Some guys may be tempted to not give her a clean break or feel they have to diminish her as a person to satisfy their own insecurities. DON'T DO IT! Seriously, it will hammer your karma and make life much more difficult for you in the long-term. To illustrate: 2006 girlfriend only dated me because of the good things 2005 girlfriend told her about how good our relationship and breakup was. The same with 2007 girlfriend. It's really the way to go if you can be respectful and honor them, because more often than not, they will return the sentiment.(sorry for the length - it started as a comment, but turned into a full post - hopefully a few will find some value in it ;)Update: I decided to make this a full-on post at: <a href=""http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/"">http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/</a>",1175814060,,comment,,0.061,0.704,0.235,0.9994

When we found out about YC we thought it was ""perfect for us"". We spent a week or two struggling over answering question just right. We had no product, and had not yet considered some of the questions the application was asking. As you may guess we got an email from YC in late October saying: ---
"" We're sorry to say that we can't accept your proposal for funding.
Please don't take it personally, because most of the proposals we
rejected, we rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the
quality of the applicants.  For example, we were very reluctant to
accept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting
a startup is too much work for one person.  We also rejected a lot
of proposals simply because we couldn't understand them, or didn't
understand the problem domain well enough to judge them, or because
the project seemed too big to start on only three months of funding.We realize this process is fraught with error. It's practically
certain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful
startups.  If you do, we'd appreciate it if you'd send us an email
making fun of us; we want to learn from our mistakes.Thanks

---We told ourselves that wasn't going to stop us.... but it sorta did for a while. I wasn't done with school, but was getting dream job offers, and my co-founder was enjoying his software development job. So we didn't do much for a few months. We just kept talking about our idea for Revvu.In doing some soul searching though, I decided I had to turn down these job offers and stop wasting time in school. This is not the life I wanted. After talking to my co-founder we came to grips with the fact that... working regular jobs was the default. That was the easy way to go about life, but we wanted more than that. We are too creative and determined to be held back or stifled by the nuances of a ""job"". In January I moved across the country to live with my co-founder and work full time on our project. Shortly after that we had a full business plan, and were testing our site in closed beta. As of this week we've launched publicly and are getting encouraging user feedback. We are beginning to tap our network to find potential investors, so that we can grow the business significantly in the next 12 moths. About a week ago my co-founder brought up YCombinator for the first time in months, and we decided to apply at the last minute. Not because we NEED the living expenses, we both have savings. Also, not because we need it to feel like we're doing something. We're already confident that we're doing something, and we'll peruse other sourced of funding if we don't get YC. We applied because we know we could benefit from the mentoring, the guidance, the connections, and i guess partially because not draining our bank accounts just to eat would be kinda nice.If the author had good intentions, IMHO, we might be a model for what he was trying to communicate. We weren't ready before. We were sitting around waiting to hear back from YC in October, and nearly let our passion fade after not being accepted. This time filling out the application didn't take long at all, because we actually knew our answers. This time we have a real plan for our business and legitimately strive towards success.If we get YC... awesome, if not... thats fine too. I hope many of you are in the same boat. I hope you're building something you believe is great, and nothing will stop you. Don't get discouraged. Don't let anything slow you down.

head full of a complete proof of the Riemann
hypothesis. (This is arguably the greatest
open problem in mathematics, and is a deep
statement about the distribution of the prime
numbers, the atoms of arithmetic.) Giddy with
anticipation of certain fame, you leap out of
bed and type up the proof, in its full 500-page
glory. That done, you are seized by doubt. How
wise is it to inflict the full brunt of your genius
on your colleagues? Will anyone even listen, or
be prepared to check your proof?What you can do is re-format your write-up
into a (somewhat longer) PCP proof. Anyone
now wishing to verify your argument need only
pick a handful of words at random, and follow a
set list of instructions to conclude whether it is
correct or not. An error might have slipped in
on account of faulty working, buggy reformatting,
or outright cheating. No matter, it will be
caught with overwhelming probability. What
the reformatting step does is smear any error
all over the proof, making it easier to spot. In
much the same way, a diligent sandwich maker
will smear a smidgen of jam evenly over his
bread, rather than leaving it concentrated
in one corner, and so make the whole more
savoury....In its full splendour, PCP asserts that
any statement S whose validity can be ascertained
by a proof P written over n bits also
admits an alternative proof, Q. This proof Q
has two appealing features: it can be derived
from P in a number of steps proportional to
n^c, where c is some constant; and P can be verified
by examining only three bits of Q picked
at random. If S is true, a correct P will satisfy
the verifier with a probability of 99%. If it is not
true, any alleged proof P will trigger a rejection
from Q with a probability higher than 50%
(ref. 4). Not impressed with this error rate?
Then all you have to do is pick, instead of three
bits of Q, as many bits as are contained in this
line of text. The error probability will drop to

Finally, he recalled talking to another professor who made the case that having rules for order of operations is a bad idea (because those rules have to be memorized), and why not just parenthesize everything?  I pointed out, of course, that he was almost exactly describing Lisp.That thought, however, led me to consider the idea of making order of operations always evaluate left-to-right, except for parenthesized expressions, which would be evaluated first (in the same manner).  Leveraging this idea, perhaps it would be possible to escape the hold of exclusively using s-expressions?My main goal would be to write a general-purpose language which could be used for writing <i>any other</i> language by using the macro facilities, instead of being forced to write Lisp-like languages as appears to be the case with Lisp.

Assume there exists a world without YC, how many people will spend time doing something they believe on and make effort to take it to a point so that you can show it to someone? Probably a vast majority would anyway do it. say 90%, what YC is trying to do is - try to squeeze a percent or two of the remaining 10% by making them work by promising them that they'd fund if you come up with something interesting and that adds  a certain value to the society as a whole. So it is certainly a waste of time if - you think of an idea, write an application and decide to work on only if YC is funding it.. But not - when you are working on something or planning to work on something, YC offers you that last bit of motivation to actually go and do it because you want to play the YC gamble. And it might happen that otherwise, you end up building something, YC rejects you, but you say to yourself, what the heck, I have already done something so lets take it to a  logical conclusion (may be 90% will chicken out. but who knows one of those who persisted might be next big thing!!) YC has certainly helped them, who would have been left in ""I am planning to do"" state otherwise and I think thats what PG is essentially trying to do.

I've been working at home with various projects/jobs since I was about 24 (36 now). For the first 2-3 years, it was all part-time of 2-4 days a week but, for the past decade, it's been full-time. I tell you - even 12 years on, it is still hard to do. I do a lot of traveling  as a consultant and trainer and these are usually Monday through Friday gigs. When I get back to the ""office"" and start to work again on Monday, I've totally lost the groove lol. That's it - it only takes a week of me getting out of the mindset of working at home to lose it. When I come back to the office on Monday, I want to read reddit, catch up on all the stuff I missed and I almost always find that Mondays have a lot of wasted time in them lol. It took me probably 2-3 years initially to get the mindset down and learn how to separate work from play. Distractions are huge at home but, for a 20-something with no significant other, they are less so. Now, I have a spouse and a fun little three year old at home - those are more distracting than all the strip clubs and PS3s in the world lol. But you manage. Last bit - I would suggest that, when you are looking for a spouse/significant other, make sure that person is okay with a comment like, ""Honey, I'm going into work now. I want you to think as though my office is 30 miles away from you and you can't just walk in and ask me a question. Send me an email or phone me if you have a question.

How DARE you call me a liar? You work in a PR firm, so you use WORDS. I use LOGIC.The point of my thread was that the author was being a jerk to Paul and should apologize. When I posted the quote where it's clear the author is insulting Paul, you got all uppity about it.""your initial comment said that the author should apologize for comparing Paul to the musician.""At what point did I deny that I ""compared Paul to the musician?"" I never claimed I never said that. I simply replied to you and posted his quote you might have missed where the author said ""YC is a waste of time"" and also says, Paul is a bull who speaks ""shit"". That's why I said the author should apologize.The author obviously meant to say Steve instead of Paul, in the intro. I didn't confuse that part of the article like you arrogantly believed. The reason I compared the two is because the user shows disdain and hate for the YC, so much he even confused his friend and Paul's names, when the two had nothing to do with one another.You work in public relations so you're probably very good at attacking people. You're a liar and exaggerate by trade.Do you understand it now? Or are you attacking me just because you're a PR person trying to test your training?

The value of YC funding is not the money, $5-20 k is not hard to save or raise.   It has been encouraging and interesting to hear from so many people, who obviously find a lot of value in VC's approach, offering slight variances based on their personal situation.It is important to take what is valuable from a model and apply it to your own startup situation.  If you can implement the use the best concepts and models from other and apply them to your unique startup, you will reduce the chance of failure and save a ton of time and money. If you fallow blindly and base your success on one groups acceptance your not an entrepreneur.

It can write, it can erase. It has other things it can do because of its design- It can act as a piece of wood, so it can be used to push things on the table, or used as Lincoln Logs..  But they don't need to ADD anything to support these uses.You can decide tomorrow to use a pencil for things the developers never thought of- You can use it to trace leads, or use it to build a fort. You can use it to hold two things apart from one another, or use the eraser to hold pins..These aren't features that needed to be added. No adjustments to the pencil are necessary to support fort-building. They're new and clever ways of using what's already there.THAT's what you want to encourage. Find ways to create services that can be used in ways you never imagined.APIs are a great example of that, but there's more that can be done. Make thing simple.

rebecca_d,,,,9670,,9577.0,1525543405,,"The evolution of the Internet is constantly being challenged by creationists-Its sort of brilliant marketing (Komisar) to act as though as of your investees has a great idea it warrants another web phase (3.0?). True, no product campaign these days is complete without a rebranding of the web itself. As advertising has undergone a power shift, from the content providers to the users, advertising has somehow become a bad word. Now that end users decide what and how products will be pitched, advertising seems to stand not only for traditional, flashy, in-your-face ads, but for any product communication that has already occurred. In that sense,  advertising is perpetually over, and therefore always omnipresent.  Simply put, as more and more people research products and services online, making purchasing decisions online, and actually buy online, it seems preposterous to claim that advertising, and companies that are in the business of advertising, are in anyway passe. It is inconsistent with the evolution of the web. What I like about Komisar-backed Aggregate Knowledge is that it is creating the platform for some wonderful advertising streams. Right now, as I understand it, they are touting as part of their product targeting by the Psychology of Crowds, or the beginning of building psychological profiles of buyers. This is done on many shopping sites: If person 1 buys product A, then he will, based on group research, be interested in product B and product C and should be presented with B and C in a non-obtrusive fashion.  
What this should naturally evolve into is a better targeting-being able to differentiate between types of buyers; is she an impulse buyer that might be wooed by a flashy interface, or is she a research shopper, who needs a case study to buy? Merely providing relevant content, without the proper packaging for the individual (what I think to be the advertising formerly know as advertising) is deficient.   
Also, what is the ideal interface complexity of this shopper? For instance, in person people buy less in big stores because they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. They are more likely to buy products in a smaller store. People are more influenced by items placed at the front of the store as their shopping goals are more malleable as they enter. Not to say that these findings will translate directly to shopping behavior on the web, but we will soon have the ability to create the perfect shopping environment for an individual, and advertising will be big part of it.

e1ven,,,,9680,,9668.0,1525543406,,"I have nothing against adding features that make sense, and are refinements of the workflow.Adding a comfortable pad to a pencil makes it easier to use, and is certainly worth a bit extra to people. Adding replaceable erasers adds more, and so on.Those are potentially useful features, and they don't get in the way of people using the pencil. This is the sort of refining that should always go on. How can we make things easier for our users. How can we streamline their workflow.Part of the problem in adding feature comes when you start adding features which make the base case harder. When users start to look at the vast sums of things that CAN be done, and you lose the simplicity of the tool. Another problem is that adding features allows people to hack things, in ways that are more complex than they should be, and cause user-frustration.Let me give you an example-There was a small company I knew that kept its data in a series of excel files. They were small, and it was a quick and easy to keep track of what they were doing.As the company started to grow, they started needing more and more complex reports on the data, and were running into the limitations of what they could easily do.They started working with heavy scripting in Excel, using VBA scripts to copy data from one sheet to another, and to replicate it to backup excel files.Eventually they had a mess of files talking to one another,  doing CSV exports, then parsing them and creating new files, and the like. It worked.. Kinda.. But it was kludgey, and complex.
The problem was that they kept adding new features to their excel documents, rather than accepting that excel was Great at what it did [1], but it wasn't the right solution for them any more.Eventually, if I recall, they finally got it all moved over to a series of Access databases, which made things a lot nicer.Could Microsoft add features to Excel to make it easier for them to keep pushing it? Sure.. Should they? In this case, probably not. The features you adding need to make sense for the tool.[1] For the sake of discussion, anyway ;)",1175887678,,comment,,0.03,0.862,0.108,0.973

Start with some adult stem cells from the HIV patient to be treated, specifically the stem cells that produce T cells. We introduce the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene and grow the cells in culture. These can then be ""transplanted"" back into the patient. These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS. There will be no chance of rejection since they are the patient's own cells. Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease. It could also be used as a preventative therapy, which we can also easily test on the mice.",1175896767,,comment,,0.08,0.857,0.063,-0.8478

One IPTV company gave a talk in my e-Business course a month ago, she sang praise for Microsoft because they have the most complete strategy in IPTV world. FYI, IPTV is better than YouTube. Let's admit it, people need to hear new information, new gossips, new products and new toys. But only time will tell if these new stuffs can replace Microsoft. The other thing is, if Desktop is dead, why am I keep hearing news about Slingshots, Apollo and WPF/E ?Maybe Microsoft knows how broken the WWW is and they prefer not to build their interest around it (other than just to be another big player next to Yahoo! and Google because they have pride and they want to be acknowledged that they still can be a big player in any field..)MS isn't dead yet, not until they stop creating software/hardware and move to the business/consulting field. It's true that they lost the ""touch"" and that they lost in understanding their customer, but they're not as bad as you envisioned.Of course you're writing this essay to fire up these hotshots or web 2.0 wannabes to quit their jobs and to forget applying for big companies and make a web2.0 thing for YCombinator (^_^)

I agree with many of the things that you say, but the fact of the matter is that much of the economy - domestic and global - runs in a Windows environment.  Most consumers still run Windows.  Am I missing the point?  Perhaps.  I suppose it is true that anybody who takes personal computing seriously is running Firefox and Thunderbird and Google Desktop on Windows.  In that sense, yeah Windows is dead.  Personally, I use Macs, so I am well insulated from Microsoft.  However, they are alive and well if only because of the Office suite.  If I send a an OpenDocument file to ten of my friends, they won't be able to open it.  If I send a Word file, everybody can open it.  The point is, Microsoft is still quite relevant today.  Although, I can see your points and would fully agree that free Linux could easily supplant Windows as a desktop environment (to run your stated Web 2.0 apps) or Macs.  I applaud your essay; you take some interesting positions and provide some profound insight.  Very interesting.  Brad Engelmann.

What is the product supposed to do? A corollary is to ask, what can a user do with my product that he can't do without it? The answer to these questions should be a single, simple, focused answer.2. What is the absolute minimum feature set we must have in order for the product to do what the user needs? Question EVERYTHING. If you're designing an email product, ask yourself if you even need folders. If you're designing a MS Word killer, ask yourself if you even need a Save. If you're designing a media player, ask yourself if even need a play/pause button.After you have the minimum feature set, release the software and iterate quickly based on user feedback. Nothing can replace raw feedback from strangers who don't give a crap about you or your product. See what the users like and dislike about the product, based on first hand observation. More tricky is keeping the product simple in response to user feature demands. Adding features is good, but only when you do it in such a way that it complements your answer to the original question: ""What is the product supposed to do?"" You have to think about how each and every additional feature deeply integrates into your existing product, rather than tacking features on haphazardly. This is difficult to do.

Also, the files can be huge, and in a web-hosted environment, the file storage would have to be absolutely massive and absolutely fast.An interesting note is that Autodesk started out with Autocad, which they coded in lisp (eventually transformed into autolisp.)  They took the MS model to software development and proceeded to make bigger and more complex versions with increasing quantities of bugs to the extent that multiple crashes per day were the norm.  But they owned 80% of the world cad market, they became the 2nd largest software company in the world.Revit was developed by a small company with an incredibly sound software architecture with a database at the core(without the massive bandaids that had piled up in Autocad and are still there today.) and developed a devoted cult following.  Autodesk fought back with ""Architectural Desktop"", which I bought (before I knew about Revit).  Their version:  Cut a section through a building, wait 30 minutes.  Revit, Cut a section through a building - instantly.  Autodesk got very scared, then bought Revit.

Interest rates for business loans are what, 6-8%?  It's not uncommon for a well-run, growing business with a strong franchise to earn a ROC of about 25%.  Debt lets them grow faster, sooner, and then they can pay off the debt from future earnings.  It's often far more capital-efficient than floating an equity offering, where the investors would get a share of all those additional profits.It doesn't work for web startups because web startups often have far lumpier earnings.  It's not uncommon for a web startup to be bought for multi-millions before they earn a dime of profit.  That's because their real ""customers"" are big companies, who are paranoid about losing their market to an upstart.  A web startups users are effectively an advertising expense: spend a few thousand on bandwidth to show that if you wanted, you could take over the world, and then get a big company to buy you to prevent that from happening.There are some web startups that employ debt financing very effectively.  For example, Akamai floated close to $300M of convertible bonds to fund its expansion.  As a result, it effectively acquired a lock on the content-delivery business, which has allowed it to grow by leaps and bounds over the past 5 years.

The idea was to develop a web based operating system for people that have never used or are uncomfortable with current computers. We had initially envisioned it as a product bundled with hardware but decided we would be unable to finance that, so we'd start with just the software.Of course, the YCs immediately understood that the associated hardware was an important part. They suggested that a good starting point was an ""internet picture frame with email."" Instead of going with their suggestion, we defended our own.They also spent a lot of the interview comparing our product to yahoo.com which was another direction we didn't think the interview would go.In the end, we were rejected because we didn't have a functioning demo. It was a dumb move on our part, and I would say a demo is an absolute must for the interview. I really regret making it as far as we did and not having a demo. We threw away our opportunity. I've heard that one demo-less team was told at their interview to make a demo in the next 24 hours, so be prepared for a serious test of your ability to get things done if you don't have a demo. Being undergrads didn't help us either. If you're an undergraduate, make it clear to the YCs that you are absolutely committed to starting a company and that you intend to drop out and work on it whether or not you get funding from them.For me, it's all moot because I got myself banned from Y Combinator after I made a really dumb Techcrunch comment.

I think the path is really very straightforward.   Assuming you're a developer, get a job, preferably with a local startup.  Live really cheap. Work really hard, save %50 of your gross income.  Do this for 6 months to a year and you won't need YC or TS funding.In the evenings and weekends, build your idea. If you've got funding to finish your university degree, then build your idea in your spare time and stay in school.  Not as good, but a number of stratups have come out of college started projects (eg: napster, facebook.) The really important thing is not so much your idea, but the skills that will come with trying to make your idea a success.Trying to make it a success and totally failing is much more valuable than getting a job writing enterprise software or staying in school.

mattjaynes,,,,9991,,9969.0,1525543452,,"Wow, this is awesome. Unfortunately it will probably be a good wait before this is built and released to the public.In the meantime, I've been developing a framework using EC2, S3, S3DFS (DFS = Distributed File System) along with SQLite to try and solve the database problem on AWS. S3DFS allows you to mount an S3 bucket to one or multiple EC2 instances as if it were a local filesystem. It works at the block level and has read/write caching - so is very fast. (Note: It's free to use for development, but otherwise requires a paid commercial license.)Since SQLite uses flat files and has no database server or client, it is ideal for use on S3. SQLite only scales well to a point, so to get around its limitations I am separating each user into their own database (each database is a separate flat file). This can sometimes be a bad idea, but SQLite allows you to attach multiple databases together to essentially create a temporary master database where you can run queries across all the user databases at once. This will be handy for search indexing, site-wide stats, etc. In order to change the user databases I will have utilities to allow global scheme alterations.So, by adding EC2 instances that are all attached to the same S3 bucket, and using round-robin dns to distribute traffic among them, you can theoretically scale a web service infinitely. Just launch a new EC2 instance and add it to the round-robin dns pool and you're done!

I think that at least a third of the text could have been removed without taking out any content.  Heck, some of the content could have probably been removed without taking away from the point the author is trying to convey.To make the analogy even more succinct, I will first ask you a different question.  Have you switched to Firefox?  It wasn't long ago that I went from using IE6 to using Firefox.  Before too long, between tabs, quick searches, customizable toolbars, incremental page search, and more, I found myself saying, ""Wow, this is what browsing should be.  How did I ever use IE?""  Lisp is the same way.I disagree with the article's conclusion, ""Learning Lisp is an uphill battle.""  If you have a good reference, it is not hard to start programming in Lisp.  You could learn Lisp by writing trivial code in about the same amount of time it would take to learn C or Java.  In fact, your code would probably be structured in much the same way.  Once you've learned enough Lisp, however, and once you get to the chapter on macros (of whatever Lisp reference you're using), something will click.  Then you will realize that you have been programming all wrong all along, and you will instantly rewrite everything you've ever done in one red-eyed night.  The next morning, you will be reborn.But seriously, if you really want to learn Lisp, drop the $40 (or whatever it costs at the moment) on <i>ANSI Common Lisp</i>; it's a great read.  Once you plow through that and are hungry for more, look for <i>On Lisp</i> or <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>; both of them are available online.If it wasn't for my classes with their requirements to program in C++ or Java, I never would have looked back after learning Lisp.

You've got to give them some credit for that. Of course, this can all change with Vista and maybe even XP eventually.

mattjaynes,,,,10019,,10008.0,1525543456,,"Thanks, AWS is amazing and has been super fun to play with. This solution will of course only work for a certain subset of apps. Apps that require more database complexity will not be a good fit for this framework. My apps are typically designed so simply that they could just use a flat-file storage system instead of a db. SQLite is awesome because it provides the flat-file storage, but in a format that allows you to query it like a normal database. The simplicity of that model is amazing and hard for me to resist. I've used mysql clusters in most of the projects while working for companies, but I often found that the added complexity did little for us. My last company hired two database guys with fat salaries just to manage it. My goal with this framework is to really reduce the cost of maintenance, backups, etc. S3 is distributed and so really doesn't need much in the way of  backups - but backing up this system is a simple as tar gziping the directory of flat-file databases.
This was interesting from pg's Viaweb FAQ:<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/vwfaq.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/vwfaq.html</a>""What database did you use?We didn't use one. We just stored everything in files. The Unix file system is pretty good at not losing your data, especially if you put the files on a Netapp.It is a common mistake to think of Web-based apps as interfaces to databases. Desktop apps aren't just interfaces to databases; why should Web-based apps be any different? The hard part is not where you store the data, but what the software does.While we were doing Viaweb, we took a good deal of heat from pseudo-technical people like VCs and industry analysts for not using a database-- and for using cheap Intel boxes running FreeBSD as servers. But when we were getting bought by Yahoo, we found that they also just stored everything in files-- and all their servers were also cheap Intel boxes running FreeBSD.(During the Bubble, Oracle used to run ads saying that Yahoo ran on Oracle software. I found this hard to believe, so I asked around. It turned out the Yahoo accounting department used Oracle.)""",1175951807,,comment,,0.046,0.849,0.106,0.9715
polibius,,,,10020,,9770.0,1525543456,,"I agree with you: Microsoft is dead, long ago. However you fail to note that another famous victim of Google, Javascript and broadband is Apple itself.
In fact desktop software in general is dead. Word processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, image editing, project management and many other traditional desktop killer-apps are now offered for free on the web. Let's face it: only professional graphic designers and architects really need the power of Adobe Creative Suite or Autodesk Autocad and, as a consequence, a Windows or Apple machine.How people are coping with this new reality? There are, in my view, two different attitudes. People more sensitive to hype are buying expensive Apple laptops even when they are simply overkill for their real needs. Programmers buying Apple laptops just to run Textmate are similar to fashion victims buying the latest Gucci handbag. Other people are more rational and choose cheap but sound Linux boxes (especially the Ubuntu flavor).I think 90% of computer users can live with Ubuntu without any problem. Of course the desktop software libraries for Linux are very meagre compared to Microsoft and Apple's universes but we've just stated that desktop software is dead: web apps' user experience is the same on every platform. The operating system really doesn't matter. Don't you have other needs to satisfie instead of buying an expensive and useless Apple fashion laptop? Buy a cheap laptop, install Linux and enjoy your life!And what about the business side of the moon? What will happen when companies will suddenly discover they don't longer need desktop software? Companies are more cost-conscious and I assume they will migrate to Linux en masse.

I would thus say that your observation comes from clique formation, and perhaps doesn't reflect the overall industry.  I freelance IT for organisations which go all the way from accountancy firms, to car sales chains, market chains, Art and Commercial offices, and realtime tracking/monitoring of heavy equipment.  Out of all those (and there are often several under each heading,)I visit one Citrix office but they are going to Terminal Server ASAP.  One company is busily switching from OSS server structures to Windows 2003 Servers. Cannot argue with it - MS often comes out cheaper, there is definitely more skill in the arena than there is skill in the Linux / OSX area, and tens of thousands of users still want a cute Window Start button.  Out of some 20 businesses I do on demand IT for, one - only one - is a Mac shop, and a shambles it is too.  They are graphics artists.  One shop has custom boxes at the mineface talking to Windows 2003 Servers back at the office.  One uses their own proprietary Application between mobile trucks and huge Wintel servers. The other 18 are MS shops doing everything from running fish markets all over town on RDP links, to monitoring, to aerial surveying, to good old accountancy under a wall to wall Windows environment.  I see Linux boxes as routers and firewalls, Macs as the liberal arts students' foolproof workstation.  Everyone I work for who is serious, runs Wintel machines.

Once the servers are kept away from the social networking sites, they must continually get new blocks of IP addresses to leach out the content, which really isn't all that hard.  (There's no magical javascript that will let the user's browser load what part of those site that you want.  Normally the server goes in on the back end and acts like a proxy, spitting out content to a different interface.  I always thought this approach wouldn't work for long without the social networking sites eventually blocking the servers, but then again, look at how meebo did it with all the messaging clients, and didn't get blocked.)This is based off of the idea that many people will be members of several social networking sites at once.  This notion of ""facebook will have more users than myspace"" doesn't mean that the users are completely different people.  The majority of the users will be on both.  I myself have a facebook and a myspace.  Most of my friends just stay on myspace, so I find myself logging into both sites all the time.  I bet this will work. :)

Pervasive devices are taking over as the key interface to systems.3. Collaboration is the big wave on the web.4. Privacy/Trust - things like google apps work for some data (and are a great addition) but add in trust and privacy in business and they're screwed. Open ID is thinking about identity, but there's a long way to go.For these reasons there is a long way to go before anyone can be considered alive or dead.

Which is why MS will just not come back ever. They may be able to use Ajax, or other technologies, but they will never be able to change their culture. Doing so would require them to repudiate Bill Gates , et al and they are not going to do that. We should thank them in a way, because rather than having to compete against a mob of dinosaurs, MS has killed the others off for us - Novell for example. Thanks Bill.

In Smalltalk, any infix operator is just a binary message send, and they're parsed left to right.  So for example, 12 + 6 / 3 results in 6 instead of 14.  This result seems perfectly natural to most Smalltalkers, but it drives me nuts.Personally, I think it's important to consider the audience when designing a programming language (or anything, really).  Operator precedence is totally illogical and adds lots of unnecessary complexity - but it's drilled into people's heads from elementary school onwards.  It's like Qwerty keyboards, American date formats, and English spelling.  In most cases, though, it's better to work with people's illogical expectations than to say ""No, you're wrong, here's a better way.""  Perhaps that's why Lisp never caught on.

Provided you know what you are building, get working on the ACTUAL start-up rather than worrying too much about funding. There are people on the other end of spectrum too that start too many startups. I was on that end and had to conciously control my urge to start new things and focus on one thing. A lot of you guys here though that have been THINKING about a start-up for months now just need to do it!1. Call a meeting of your partners to finalize what product you are building; PIN DOWN who will use it; have SOME idea how you will get users2. Have another meeting and sketch out all the functions3. Start coding; set tight deadlinesOne thing that might help is to start thinking of what you are doing not in terms of a start-up but as a product. When we say start-up we associate with it all the luggage of fund raising etc. but when you are just building a product it is a very specific goal you are after.Good luck!-Zaid

twocents,,,,10146,,9770.0,1525543474,,"I agree, MS is definitely moving in this direction... though not quite dead. They just need a little help getting there. A few additional points...1. Data formats: The Operating System is becoming less important. The focus should continue to be toward standards. Proprietary Data formats, such as DOC are slowly dying. This is absolutely one of the keys (as evidenced by MS's reaction to Massachusetts when they attempted to pass legislation requiring the use of Standards on their documents).MS has spent nearly their entire dev cycle ensuring ""vendor lock in"". This is beginning to end. You mentioned JavaScript as an attempt to compromise popular 3rd party solutions. Further research will turn up an unbelievable number of attempts at this (some successful others just a joke and a waste of the customer's time).The message to ALL users is this: <i></i>Keep your data open<i></i> It's your data and you should have access to it from more than one company or Application. Avoid forced upgrades and security issues when MS decides to stop supporting an application.2. Hasta la Vista: BrandonM pointed out MS's apparent contempt for the customer - and contempt is what it is. This is why Windows XP will absolutely be the last OS I ever use from MS. It doesn't make a difference to me if Vista is the greatest OS ever or can be completely killed by an animated cursor. MS has done more to alienate their customers than all the competing products and companies together have been able to do. Alternatives are now ready and available.3. Alternative OSes: The re-emergence. This area has continued to rise in prominence thanks in large part to Linux, BSD and OS X as well as serverLinux on hosting accounts. Upper-tier Operating systems such as Apple's OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris are exciting viable alternatives. Second-tier Operating Systems such as OS/2 (eComStation) - capable of running modern browsers (Firefox) and applications can also fill a niche.Even fundamentally sound and high-quality third-tier OSes; such as AmigaOS4 and The RiscOS are beginning to see new momentum, as a result of Web Apps and the kind of backlash Microsoft has created among too many users. While I think these 3rd-Tier OSes need additional modern softTek, I hope they hang in there and continue to progress forward. The OS battle is a war not a battle won within a year or two.4. Web 2.0 Apps: not just Internet/WAN-based... There is no reason why internet enabled apps couldn't reach <i>any</i> desktop OS. A complete local LAMP environment, for example, can easily be set up on any number of alternative Operating Systems. So if your needs can be filled with Web-based Applications, they can also be run locally (or over a LAN) for enhanced speeds. Even portable computing devices (Nokia N800, Pepper Pad, etc..) shouldn't have a problem setting up this environment.By default, these types of apps are network-centric. Businesses already loves and need them but many solutions are currently custom-built. Web Apps will continue to grow in functionality and will find a home on low-cost LAMP infrastutures as opposed to the more expensive WIMP or proprietary windows architecture.5. Pointed out in the article was the power of a monopoly. A user commented on it's ability to kill competition. There was at least one objection to this. Below is only <i>one</i> example of the <i>many</i> instances of mafia-like bahavior by Microsoft:<a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/</a>In general, arrogant and abusive behavior by any company has a negative effect (google: Sony, DRM, backdoor rootkit OR Intel cpu tracking ID privacy). Are commercial software and digital media companies in danger? Yes... Google (as well as many users) are aware of the dark side of capitalism. This dark side has opened the door to GPL software (as well as various other open source licenses) and the famous ""do no evil"" guarantee from a major international vendor - probably a first in the history of commerce (maybe someone can verify this).6. Newbies: The most important segment of the population and the hardest to reach. It wasn't until the emergence of Firefox that this group began to take notice of the failings of MS. Microsoft has never recovered from this. IE7 with it's built-in advertising, constant registry writes and lack of portability to even other MS OSes was not the solution.Thanks but no thanks, Microsoft. You are a dinosaur, a relic from a time we will all hopefully soon forget.

Remember, Microsoft, like any adversary, has a vote.A couple of things still slowing down the transition.  1.) Broadband is not yet universal.  Rural areas don't have it always and it they do, it is pricey to get.
2.) The installed base will use Win OS's for quite a while still (i.e., Office, engineering apps, business apps), my bet is on a ten year transition.
3.) There is still and will always be value in a stand alone system with an operating system and a cpu onboard for the same reason that the internet was invented.

If you consider all of the software and configurations that exist for any given Linux install (a virtually infinite number), then you have to admit that Linux has come a long way in about 15 years.  After all, Microsoft had a 10-15 year head start and the advantage of being able to throw money at the annoying little problems that open source programmers don't like to work on.As for Ubuntu, I personally have not been very happy with it.  I have had much better luck using Gentoo, being quite satisfied with the software management system (called portage), and their approach of compiling everything.  My system is very stable and fast, without too much effort.I will admit that there are some problems trying to work with closed-source software like the Java browser plug-in and Flash, but there are generally step-by-step how-tos out there that say exactly how to get it working.  64-bit is still a bit rough in a few places.

Currently Google is the most dangerous company for companies who bring a new application, but even they are not as dangerous as Microsoft was.

A small project would be something that is a $1B business.  It's an amazing scale--growing your business by a billion dollars is less than 2% growth and barely moves your stock price (you know, the CEO's goal).In the space of YCombinator, start-ups are lucky to be targeting a tenth of that small move.  They're not dangerous to those players because they've simply stepped beyond that level of playing the game.  Sure, one of those start-ups could emerge to be the next big idea, but Microsoft can afford to sit back and acquire them or jump into the market when they see the opportuntity, after a couple attempts at a profitable model have assumed some of the risk.  They have no need or incentive chase every little opportunity.  Their not going to get it right every time, they missed both online auctions (eBay) and walk-up ad serving (Google), but missing these hardly renders the company dead or irrelevant.

stopbuggingme,,,,10195,,9770.0,1525543481,,"This article is absolutely ridicolous. First of all, ""Web 2.0"" and ""AJAX"" software won't ever replace Desktop Software, period. The first issue is Performance. JavaScript is awfully slow compared to real programming languages, and this won't change because of some language-specific features. An eMail or calendar application is certainly doable with JavaScript (even though they still aren't as good as desktop software because of the latency). Perhaps even word processing and spreadsheets will be possible with an AJAX app, even though the current AJAX ""word processing"" and ""spreadsheet"" apps are ridiculous compared to MS or OpenOffice. But other things, like image editing, video editing, rendering and 3D games just aren't feasible with AJAX. JavaScript is too slow to compute stuff on the client and the latency is too high to do everything on the server, and also someone would have to pay for the server the work is being done on. It won't happen. 
But even if it were technically feasible it wouldn't happen. That's because it doesn't offer many advantages over traditional apps. Sure, you can access your data from everywhere, but for everything that matters, that is already the case. For example, IMAP is spreading more and more - why on earth would i use some crappy AJAX eMail client? 
And there's another very important reason why AJAX won't take over the World: privacy. There are a lot of things that i just don't want to lie around on someone elses server. Secondly, high-bandwith connections aren't available for everyone. Think of people living in rural areas, and of people who just don't need it. Yes, those people do exist, and they won't spend 20Â/Month just to do what they already do with conventional software. Thirdly, it's just not true that ""All the computer people use Macs or Linux now"". I study CS, and while most of my fellow students have tried Linux, nearly everyone returned back to Windows. That's because nearly every interesting piece of open source software is available for Windows too, while there is a lot of software that is Windows-only. An OS is just a platform for running software, and the software is what matters.In the end, you even claim that Microsoft sucks. Well, the truth is, they don't really suck very hard anymore. Yes, Windows 1.0-ME were crap, but the Windows NT/2000/XP series is good enough for most people (I haven't tried Vista yet). I've never worked with Visual Studio, but <i>a lot</i> of people claim it's a superb IDE for C/C++. Then you have MS Office. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for almost everyone, and it doesn't suck any harder than it's primary competition, OpenOffice.org (In fact, OpenOffice.org's Base doesn't even come close to the functionality of Access and there is also no good replacement for Visio - no, Dia and Kivio aren't, and then there is Sharepoint and Exchange and a lot more). Claiming that Microsoft Software generally sucks doesn't help, because it's simply not true, and by expressing stuff like that you only make a fool of yourself.

And .Net is what will keep them ticking.  (Office too, but that's a different post.  Have you seen what MindManager has done with Word?)
If anyone wants to put the last nail in their coffin, build a better .Net.  And do it with Lisp..Net shows what we have needed for a long time.  A consistent development platform where it doesn't really matter what language you program in.  Everything gets compiled down the same way, everyone uses the same API and libraries.
But the syntax is locked away and guarded (big surprise coming from a monopolist).  You can't easily find it, and you sure as hell can't easily change it.  And even if you do, the byte-code doesn't offer any more power than the over-language.
All you can do is beg for a change, and maybe a year later you will get a watered down version.Free us from our syntax chains.You've gone on at length about how cool Lisp is.  How it can be morphed into whatever language is needed at the time.
So prove it.  Fix .Net by describing the language syntax in Lisp.  Give the end programmer the ability to see and adjust their chosen language to behave as needed on a project by project basis.  And do it in a way that will actually get used.Instead of making a 100 year language, make a 100 year platform where the language can shift as the problems and fads do.
It won't be easy, but it might just change the world.

Nowadays, when MS peceives a startup to be a threat, they rather them acquire them than out-compete them; it's cheaper.Also, I can see Microsoft changing already. .Net Framework v3.0 is actually impressive (which follows tradition: MS always needs three tries to deliver something that is any good).They're definitely catering to the web now with WPF+WPF/E+XML+Atlas+Expression tools, etc.; these are acually great tools (even if rough around the edges) and they can exist and be used alongside all the open source and standards stuff (yes, WPF/E runs on say Firefox on Linux as well); there is no conflict anymore.So, take your average Windows developer/ISV: they know Windows stuff and now they get a bunch of extra tools to help them develop for the web. Why on earth would they switch to Linux or Apple development? By staying with Windows they can slowly migrate their apps and their customers to the web without disrupting anything.And MS has both the resources and the patience to go the distance with this.MS Dead? Nah, don't see it happening. MS no longer to be feared? Sure, but, uh, in what way does that matter, except to incumbent startups?

mint,,,,10218,,9770.0,1525543484,,"well, is IBM dead?It seems to me that the word dead really sends people off the edge.IBM is doing better than they were when they made computers. To give them credit, Microsoft could be in the transitional phase. I mean, can you honestly say that you've never played 20 straight hours of Halo on an XBox? I know I can't.Call me optimistic or just crazy, but I still believe that Microsoft is a competitor in technological innovation. I think Google will suffer from the same condition that plagued Microsoft during 2001-2005 (massive egos). This will help other companies (including Microsoft) get their footing and potentially launch a comeback (as Apple did).It seems easy to denounce Microsoft as an evil corporation. It's harder to recognize that they have battles of their own. Remember those antitrust cases? Microsoft was given grief for packaging IE into Windows (let's see, who else packages a wad of their own software into their operating system? hmmmmm.....). Do a search for torrents and you can find the latest Windows (or any windows version). Did geeks believe that stealing someone's hard work was cool? Hell yes. Microsoft is the paranoid old man that it is because we helped put it there while we give graces and laud Google and Apple.
I use a Thinkpad running Windows XP (and Ubuntu).To address your Apple computer usage by geeks: it's the same problem with most amateur photographers, they still think fancy toys are vital in making a photograph (ie having Mac OSX in no way improves your abilities as a designer).Like many others have said: stick around and let's see what happens.Meanwhile, anyone up for a game of ultimate frisbee?",1175986814,,comment,,0.171,0.706,0.123,-0.9508

I disagree that the desktop is dead though, I think that many people overestimate the capabilities of the of the web as it is today (give it a few more years).  This might just be me overreaching and being completely wrong, but I believe that desktops will have a greater role in the far future because people will be able to host and manage their own slices of the internet.  In a few years the desktop will be the equivalent of a glorified facebook profile and weblog hosted by the individual, and the user experience will be something of an integrated desktop/internet environment with web 2.0 companies reduced to widgets downloaded onto the desktop.  Maybe.  Thanks for the good essay Paul.

Wow, what a mess. Talk about spaghetti code that had mushroomed into a giant ball of mud. It was <i>way</i> over budget and took much longer than anyone anticipated. And a year later, it still only supports Internet Explorer and Windows.My take on what went wrong in this instance: they did not manage complexity.They let it grow and grow and did not believe that 'code debt' was a reality. It soon took 10 times longer to make even the simplest changes because of the very poor state of the code.I have seen this happen at several companies and it's usually the same story. There are B and C level coders that don't understand the dangers or code complexity or code debt and thus create loads of both. The A level coders that do understand this try to explain the growing problem to management. The management doesn't know any better, so they see code cleanup as a needless expense that will only slow down rolling out new features and so they side with the B and C level coders. Of course, the irony is that development will eventually crawl to a near halt because the code is undecipherable. Along the way the A level coders get so frustrated with the state of the code base that they leave the company for greener pastures. This is the critical turning point since the B and C level coders will only hire other B and C level coders - and the project will die a slow death as the cycle continues.",1176006949,,comment,,0.124,0.809,0.067,-0.956

However, the site was cutting edge when I first had it on in 1995 and was published a few years in a row in the book _Design Portfolio_ with interviews, etc. in the late 90's.  My site has been neglected as I've been too busy (too many projects, etc.), but the thrust of the site is the imagery and design and ideas, not the fonts.  That is the value people get from the site and why it is so heavily linked and visited.  I am definitely looking forward to having the site totally automated and database driven so that I can control the look and feel globally (the site is huge if you noticed) and have it always up to date finally later in the year.But to take it off because of imperfect fonts and frames etc. would be foolish.  I would be denying the value that so many people are getting from the site in its current crippled form.   But thank you for the concern :)",1176010535,,comment,,0.052,0.853,0.095,0.8957

I've been using Linux since 1993, been involved in startups since 1999, and about the last time that I paid <i>any</i> attention to Microsoft was when they launched .NET (around 2003). In fact, the .NET implementation (a belated catch-up in many ways to Java) was about the only semi-innovative development effort I have seen come out of MS in the last 10 years. Even so, it was little more than a tarted-up virtual machine, a cleaned-up set of Java-equivalent programming APIs, and a couple of cool features like crypto-signed DLLs, a global assembly cache (hmm - where do <i>you</i> put all <i>your</i> JAR files, then?!) and the ability to mix and match programming languages in a single application (though only one target language per DLL, or more strictly, per .NET ""assembly""). Then, Miguel and the gang came along and wrote Mono, and pretty much re-implemented everything of value from .NET, without the licencing overheads of running in a windoze only environment. That basically took the wind out of the sails for Microsoft, and they've been floating around, almost impassive, pretty much just watching the emergence of ASP/SaaS computing, web 2.0, AJAX, Ruby on Rails, blogging, wikipedia, bittorrent, skype, asterisk and everything else from the sidelines ever since.I think the real problem comes back to people. It's a bit like Paul's articles on Great Hackers and what motivates them. I know plenty of great hackers (and I would like think that a couple of startups later I am at least a good one! - though I find myself more and more on the business side in recent times, growing our company and developing our people - good young hackers themselves). I even used to know a few guys at Microsoft (Australia and Singapore). The last ""good"" person that I knew who went to Microsoft (from a PhD programme at Melbourne Uni) joined in 2002. Since then, nobody I know even went near the place. If you can't attract great people, then you won't build great products, and everything else is a forgone conclusion. Microsoft has built great cash-cow businesses, and great fortunes for its founders, but I don't believe it will ever be a player again.",1176012266,,comment,,0.009,0.888,0.103,0.9769

Maybe the competitors are locked-in to some bad design decisions and can't quite recreate the same user experience... but that's a little optimistic.Anyway you slice it, you need to have a profit margin. And with a commodity like storage (and the soon-to-be commodity of online storage), you have to be competitve with market prices. The reason that most YC startups can worry about user adoption is because they aren't tied down to this problem. They aren't really making commodities and the cost of makign the product isn't so suffocating.That's why Dropbox needs to plan for moving off S3. There is so much innovation in storage backends... so much research to read. Think of Google Filesystem. It makes storage very very very cheap.Here's a good plan for Dropbox. Use S3 as a secondary solution. The primary storage should be local to them (servers running a filesystem that takes advantage of unique properties of the workload... like Google does). When it fills up, traffic thereafter is handled by S3 instead. Then, they can relax in worrying about and scaling local storage. They can take their time buying more hardware, and rolling out software changes to the storage system. They can migrate the data from S3 to local storage at will. And now, their customers can be charged a flexible price, because they control their own expenses. In other words, think of S3 as ""datacenter outsourcing"".But this might be too long-term... it might be something to worry about post-YC.But I think it might be easy to build a storage implementation that runs local and exposes the same exact interface as S3. And, poof, we just abstract the whole backend away, and just flip a switch when we want to go one way or the other. And it reduces latency. Then you go after zero-downtime data migration from S3 to your local systems... which can be done I think... and I think you would be happy.",1176014450,,comment,,0.057,0.834,0.109,0.9668

stevej098,,,,10441,,6668.0,1525543520,,"1. <i>the</i> best piece I've ever read on startups.2. These ideas don't just apply to technology startups.
They apply to new businesses generally.3. Walt Disney couldn't make it on his own, knew this and got his brother Roy out of hospital (!) to work with him. Roy outlived Walt. Walt painted castles in the air, Roy built the (economic) foundations. 
= Co-founder good, Creative+Executor great :-)
= There has to be real trust/loyalty between the founders. With enormous wealth on offer, enough people go crazy & try to take it all. A partner you don't know well can take you down easily.4. 'Founders', a.k.a. entrepeneurs, are more willing to take <i>risk</i> than most people - which means they get pretty comfortable with failure. They are also a special breed.
= Comfort is the enemy of Change.
= Change is Risk, but the only way forward.
= Comfortable people won't pursue a startup vigorously...5. How do you get your Founders to ""put skin in the game""? To have a personal stake in the outcome? (Besides losing their dream - or is that generally enough?)6. One of the most important personal traits of a great entrepeneur - keeping a journal... Gotta write everything down. Crops up repeatedly in biographies. Richard Branson is quite clear about it - but doesn't relate it to his success. There is supposedly some research that says 1.5-3% of all people write down their goals. Once there was a long-term Ivy League school study (is this apocryphal?) showing that people who wrote down their goals out-performed others by 5:1 or 10:17. People are different. Some are shy/introvert, many extrovert. Shy people don't sift through the large numbers needed to establish 'good networks' and check-out who'd make a good partner.
Many of the best geeks are quiet & retiring folk. They will, by definition, find it hard or impossible to bring along a partner. But forcing someone on them won't work either.
This is a hard problem to solve.
= A solution is something like your ""Startup School"", but a little more frequent, to provide a mileu in which these people can mix and hook up. [As conferences and User Groups can do.][For a great example of this, see how Paul Allen was treated by Bill Gates and Steve Balmer on his last project at Microsoft.]8. The Internet changes everything. But the VC process is still face-to-face personal contact... Silicon Valley was caused by VC firms like ""Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers"" bringing money from The East into technology. Even with the hordes of imititors and rip-off merchants, greedy investors flocked and made out well...
Because the place had critical mass - in people and places to meet, and the culture to support it.
These comments are peppered with genuine frustration (& longing) from would-be entrepeneurs.
= How can the Internet overcome this tyranny?
= Business is about personal relationships. Can the Net ever replace or augment that critical factor?9. Technology support. Finding someone who is fluent with a key technology, like hardware hacking, can be critical to the success of a project/startup. When it's not your field, how do you find a way in? Then how do you get taken seriously by an expert??10. Scaling: small trials and growing entrepeneurs.
My belief is that good entrepeneurs are grown, not born. And that there are predictable growth stages for all companies.
A wealthy friends' advice is: Never attempt anything more than 30% larger than you've done before.
= Have you thought of building a process to train up entrepeneurs before they enter your funding process?
= I'm thinking graduated funding levels, starting low ($10k) and in a couple of stages getting to $500k or so.11. For solid research on what makes <i>great</i> employees, see Robert E Kelley's book ""How to be a Star Performer""

They are a powerful triplet that can't be broken through. Witness the non-musical entrants in ""American Idol"" who honestly believe they are brilliant.

""AJAX and Javascript is the new programming model of choice""
 I am currently developing a web 2.0 venture namely UReporting. Our Project is based almost entirely on Microsoft technologies. We had the option to use both LAMP based development or ASP.Net/ MS Sql. We chose Microsoft as it served all our needs and then some. Mapping, mobile, streaming, AJAX, Scalability, Community building you name it we are doing it. 
I have nothing against Javascript or AJAX but I can assure you Microsoft technologies can do everything that AJAX or Javascripting can. Also Ajax for ASP.NET is widely avaialable and used. This is a view not from someone who funds ventures but an actual entreprenuer seeking to minimize costs and develop a scalable and efficient platform.""Buy all the good ""Web 2.0"" startups. They could get substantially all of them for less than they'd have to pay for Facebook.""Interesting point especially coming from someone who funds such venture...

I'll stop because my thoughts aren't making sense anymore, but yes the Desktop is retired, and the desktop companies are dead.

GoDaddy is not a startup, it is now a pretty large company and anyone who has money to throw around on Super Bowl commercials certainly isn't a little guy.Second, GoDaddy and SalesGenie have nothing to do with each other. GoDaddy sells domain names, SalesGenie deals with businesses needing sales leads. While it is silly that they didn't test in Firefox, their market probably doesn't use Firefox that much. I'm willing to bet that 99% of their customers use IE so it really doesn't matter that much.Third, the number of people who actually know who Kevin Rose is or can recognize him is very small relatively. So while including him in their commercial might get a lot of webbies talking about it, it won't have any effect on the vast majority of their potential customers.This article made a lot of apples to oranges comparisons.

e1ven,,,,10565,,10526.0,1525543539,,"It depends on the level of reliability that you need, and the level of 
control...At the company I work for, we lease space in datacenteres in a few spots 
around the country. [1]The thing is, we do this because we have specific hardware requirements 
which require that we use our own hardware, and ensure we can't use 
anyone else's stuff very easily. The problem is, we pay through the NOSE 
for it.IMO, the optimal choice for most startups right now is to have  <i>very</i> 
few servers (if any) that their run in-house, and to host the rest with 
other people.There's a couple of reasons for this- The first is reliaiblity. Hosting 
companies have trained staff watching over the servers, and monitoring 
for a failure.
While you might do a lot to watch for failures [2], you'd save sleep and 
sanity if you only needed to monitor for logic failures, and had someone 
else (the hosting co) helping watch for hardware problems.The second major reason is Bandwidth! Getting quality, symetric 
bandwidth run to your door costs a LOT of money.. SpeakEasy DSL can get 
you started [3], you'll struggle to get anything higher that a 6.0/1Mbit 
line- For hosting, you need LOTS of upload- That 1Mbit will get taxed 
out quickly.Take a look at Bandwidth offerings by Colos- Often you get Royally 
screwed, when compared to renting a dedicated server from them.
Companies like ServerMatrix will give you 1.5 TB of monthly bandwidth 
for under $100.... That'd cost hunderds for the bandwidth alone in most 
colos.The dedicated server places tend to assume you won't fully use the line, 
so they oversell- That's how you can get th e great deals on bandwidth.. 
The nice part is that if you go with a at least semi-reputable place 
(servermatrix, rackspace, etc) they have MORE than enough to cover you, 
even if they'll a littel annoyed that you use it all ;)Read your TOS carefully.Amazon's EC2 program is amoung the best for hosting, if you can get into 
it. It allows you to dynamically scale up the number of servers, and has 
very decent prices.
This is among the best options for a startup because you can load 
balance to handle spikes in traffic, such as Digg, Techcrunch or Slashdot.One other point I'll briefly touch on is depreciation of assets- If you 
buy your own servers, and add them to a colo, when they get old, you 
lose a lot of the initial value. You're often not going to want to keep 
the old servers in the farm, once they're so low they'll do more harm 
than good. With renting servers, along with the additional bandwidth and 
uptime, you get the advantage of being able to just say ""I'm done with 
these servers."", and lose nothing.-Colin
[1] I can't actually tell you the places for confidentiality reasons, 
but it's not important for this discussion anyway.[2] Nagios Alerts to the Cellphone are a good start..[3] Chosen because of good TOS, and reputation, but with the Bestbuy 
deal, be on your guard here. The situation could change quickly.

Take-aways from this:<i>It is tempting to get a co-founder quickly, if only to validate your idea.  That's fine, but don't approach potentials just because you believe there is a high chance of them accepting.  Always try to bring in the best people you know.  </i>Know that you can work well together. Often said, but it's still worth repeating.<i>Presentations are great, but it's easier to convince someone to spend their time on an idea when you back your presentation up with a demo.

PC makers won't want to switch to Linux either because of tech support. 
Microsoft still has a very big share of the market and no one can deny it. Sure the iPod helps Macs sell, but not enough for Microsoft to care. 
Here's the argument, everyone needs an operating system and something that just works. Linux is still not for the average human, and PC makers won't resell something from Apple. Right now Microsoft wins, and probably will for the next five to ten years. Sure there are Firefox, Google, Linux, but people just want something that works and to be honest Microsoft offerings are good enough.P.S.

At the time, while doing research for my Strategic Defenestration Initiative (another story), I had read an editorial (URL: <a href=""http://linux.sys-con.com/read/84967.htm"">http://linux.sys-con.com/read/84967.htm</a> -- the editor could use some editing) in Linux SYS CON which argued that LAMP and open source technology enabled Google and Amazon.com to grow ""...quickly into industry leaders.""

And now they were successful enough to replace their open source Linux and Apache infrastructure with proprietary software systems (Windows) if they wanted, but they had not done so.  
During the question and answer period, I asked the speaker whether Google had the financial and technical means to migrate their servers from Linux to Windows. He replied that they could do this. I couldn't resist: I then asked the speaker whether Google would go ahead and migrate all their servers to Windows.

whacked_new,,,,10651,[10716],10650.0,1525543551,,"There were some mistake submissions which got deleted from the front page. They were immediately obvious as mistakes, but what if a dupe was submitted a week later? a month later? ten years later? A dupe may leave and re-enter relevance given the circumstances. In a different context, a dupe may not be a dupe, even if it references the same information.For the last two cases I saw, ""delete me"" works, but I find this self-policing idea suboptimal. There will inevitably be users in the future who make mistake submissions. If they are completely irrelevant, or carbon copies, fine. But if they are submissions like ""AMAZING PHOTO!"", what if the user finds it personally significant? As the size of the crowd grows, no matter how focused your initial crowd is, or how you intially positioned your product, there will be a scattering of interest. Unless you follow an editor and moderator model, slashdot for example, you will be unable to filter your content to a specific standard. In the case of an open-participation community, enforcing focus may be excessive: after all, the community is defined by itself, not the application it uses. If you gather more and more forgetful users, they may appreciate dupes.After you hit some sort of critical mass of users, many new users will arrive by friend recommendations, or mere interest in the community size, rather than independent discovery. Independent users join after searching for and spotting something tailored to their specific interests, but there is no guarantee that referred users fall under the same profile.In interest of monetization, it should be hard for popular sites to escape changing to accomodate a more diverse userbase. I believe this has hit both digg and reddit. Sooner or later, with the rapid growth seen here, news.yc also (which seems to evolve faster than the other news sites). In this regard, plus 1 for slashdot model (editors plus moderators). python_kiss also observed this on his project (interested in your thoughts). This also makes me question the strategy of pre-defining and then trying to self-enforce a niche in an open and user-driven website. Of course you can use subgroupings by topic, or do something like Ning, but lurkers that never bother to customize their preferences, whose numbers are probably significant, will be hard to please. You might even have better luck with them by showing random stories than by showing the most popular or most active.Maybe the popularity measure has shown its limit in usefulness. Users come for content quality, be that quality of information or emotion (flamewars give belligerent folks an adrenaline boost); the quality is driven by a few. I would come back here just to read the comments from a couple amazingly good commenters. Those comments could spawn complete discussions by themselves, like the questions from good panel moderators in conferences. More than popularity, then, the submission rating should be influenced more by the overall ""quality"" measure of the discussion. For example, in slashdot, you look at the number of comments, then the total number of, say, +5 comments. Usually it's something like, say, 10 percent. When it's significantly higher, I anticipate a good read.That reminds me again. Topic Karma is an interesting attempt. python_kiss? :)",1176090642,,comment,,0.058,0.748,0.193,0.9981

When Microsoft does a major product launch that bombs (in the sense of Battleship Earth), then I'll take this proposition seriously. While they have chart topper after chart topper, there isn's a case.
I can see that your response to the ""well they sell lots of software"" argument is dismissive, but the fact that they do says a lot. It speaks to: market dominance due to historical monopoly; continued product development and support; and continued acceptance of Microsoft products by the marketplace. 
This might sound simplistic, but these are the hard, cold facts. It's fun to predict the demise of a giant (and exciting and controversial). It's boring to predict that they'll lumber on, giant-like, for years to come. That's not interesting or newsworthy!

That's a very sick and twisted view of the world-- and it is from Karl Marx.The reality is, you make money when you bring happiness to people.  You make people happy and they want to give you money they want to buy more of your products because they want to keep being made happy again, or made even more happy.Thus, the happier you make your customers the more money you make.  Further, making people happy, and making money are intrinsically <i>moral</i> things.   Trading with people is honest and moral.Those who talk of <i>altruism</i> speak of violence. Altruism is the destruction of your self to benefit others. (Literally).  Thus socialists throw around the word ""altruism"" (and ""Sacrifice"" and a lot of other code words) to try and make it seem moral-- but at the root of it, what they are doing or advocating is putting a gun to your head and taking your money (and your money is just a representation of the labor you put in to earn it.)So, don't you talk to me about morals-- when its clear you are advocating an immoral ideology.The bottom line is this: Free people trade with each other and profit by trades that make people happy.  This trade is moral, it is honest, and it is right.  It is intrinsically peaceful.Socialists oppose free trade, they believe in forcing people at gun point to ""trade"" on terms that the socialist approve of.  This is not peaceful, this is not moral, and obviously the people who are having their lives threatened are acting under duress--- duress is not compatible with happines.So, the next time you hear ""sacrifice"" come out of the mouth of a politician -- realize its not <i>him</i> that will be sacrificing-- its <i>you</i> and he's putting a gun to your head to get richer.That is the language of the thief and the looter, the socialist and the immoral. This is so obvious that I shouldn't have to say it-- but its amazing how twisted people's minds get when they are subjected to socialist propaganda day in and day out.To think you just said people doing things that make them happy, because they make them happy is immoral!

benknight,,,,10659,[10848],9770.0,1525543552,,"I have always enjoyed reading Paul's articles/blogs.  I was enjoying reading this till I got to the line ""All the computer people use Macs or Linux now. Windows is for grandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s."" Having used gmail since March 28, 05, gcal since it came out, and other web software as appropriate for a while, I'm  a big believer in software-as-a-service because I hate the idea of having desktop software on one computer and not the other.  I also own both, an Apple PowerBook and a Dell laptop.  I find Windows a lot more keyboard friendly, since I like to fly around with both shortcut keys and the Mac just can't keep up with me.  On the other hand, I love Mac's Zen-like environment and the rock solid BSD underneath it -- Windows can seem pretty cheesy with all its pop-up baloons and MS-DOS prompt.  However, given the apps and hardware available for Windows, I still prefer Windows because I'm a developer and business guy.  I also disagree that Windows is for grandmas.  I mean, Paul, which world do you live in? Just because a niche of designers, developers and a few affluent folks use Apple, doesn't mean EVERYONE is using Macs.  Your bias clearly shows through here.I personally am not biased to any particular hardware/OS because I use them all (even Ubuntu/Linux for servers).  Having worked with 5 flavors of Unix since 1991, I feel equally comfortable with the <i>nix world, Windows and Mac OS.In the end, Apple is a cult -- it always has been.  Apple isn't any better of a company than Microsoft and neither is Google.  I've always had a love-hate relationship with Microsoft.  I hate how they try to break stuff (e.g. Java, JavaScript) but I absolutely don't mind using MS Office to get stuff done.  And, the fact that I almost entirely use open source for my development/deployment and not feel hampered on Windows combined with the fact that most of my personal information management is done using gmail/gcal, I can use Microsoft to get the best of all world: i.e. MS Office, web 2.0 apps through Firefox, anything open source (e.g. eclipse, rails, mysql), etc., etc.  I strongly believe OS will eventually become less relevant for desktops, whether it is Microsoft, Mac, or Linux.In the end, consumers have personal preferences and corporation want to make money.

I think that if the goal is to create a general-purpose programming language for consumption by the average population, it might be better to meet the expectations of the average person.  I'm not saying that it needs to be C-like necessarily, but I think that you're right that things like order of operations and other expectations should probably be properly preserved, at least for mathematical operations.I also realized that my approach was still wrong.  If the goal is to be able to build <i>any</i> programming language, the left-to-right approach would already be limited to building a language which evaluates from left-to-right.  So it seems that I still have work to do in order to figure out how best to design a language which is able to look like whatever the user desires it to.One possibility is to sacrifice ease of macro-writing for making other areas of the language more consistent (but not Lisp-like).  That is, I would like to keep the expressive power of macros high (even if it involves modifying the read table in some way) while keeping the language intuitive for a beginner.  This would likely make it a bit more difficult to write macros, but by the time you are using macros a lot, you are probably a bit more advanced, anyways.I'm thinking that there has to be some kind of grammar theory that I can leverage here, where the programmer could actually modify the language's parser in the program while maintaining consistency and lack of ambiguity, or being alerted to the potential ambiguity in case they fail to.In any case, I am quite convinced that Lisp is probably one of the most ideal languages.  This means that my hypothetical language may be an example of the phenomenon pg describes, where the best languages are those which are designed for use by the designer, and languages like Java and Cobol are the result of designing for others.  I would like to hope that's not the case here, since I'm approaching this with a use-case in mind: to design a language which can be used to design any other language.",1176103125,,comment,,0.048,0.825,0.128,0.9871

To the VCs, it's worth spending a mere $150,000 to build a strong relationship with some of the best young entrepreneurs. Sure, most of the startups will go back to school after the summer program instead of dropping out and being successful but they'll come back to Lightspeed or Highland for funding after they get their degree.Highland also funds biotech and provides lab space in their incubator.

mauricecheeks,,,,10708,[10786],10676.0,1525543559,,":-) I'm glad this got posted on here. We are building a product review site & I was super tempted to leave a comment on techcrunch. Alas, our site isn't far enough along, nor is it prepared for that kind of attention. PowerReviews/buzzillions has a pretty clever business model. Essentially its creating Sheep that $hit grass. It is a step beyond it's competition iNods, which is two steps beyond ViewScore, which are both only marginally more useful than just searching google to find reviews.But what I (we) think would be a lot cooler, is building a community around and for this tech consumer market. Our site ( <a href=""http://revvu.com"">http://revvu.com</a> ) uses a user-driven model for centralizing consumer electronic reviews on the web. Users can submit reviews that they find, or blog, or want to share. Then the community can vote reviews up or down (based on value) per each individual product page. (sort of reddit style)Votes on reviews effect the weight of ratings, forming a dynamic review score that reflects the opinion of the masses. We just launched on Monday, so karma is not yet visible. Also, our social network aspect is not in place yet. That aspect will be the key to creating a strong community, creating an addicting user experience, and creating a way to share (read: show off) the things you own & are interested in. I think PowerReviews is a cool concept, and will probably work for some retailers... but they (like everyone else in this space) don't get ""it"" yet. Aside from the arbitrary use of tagging, their site isn't really reflecting any of the advancements or evolutions of the way people use the internet today. They have found a business model that seems feasible and built an idea around it in a market that NEEDS improvement. What they lack is a carrot to attract users (those seeking reviews) to care, return, or get involved. Which might be fine for them, if thats not what they want. If thats the case though, suggesting that PowerReview (or buzzillions) ""may get the market"" doesn't sound very likely.Anyway, we'd really appreciate feedback on our site.  This is a very sharp community. We would certainly be interested to hear from, or chat with, anyone who has feedback/suggestions for us. ",1176107730,,comment,,0.018,0.838,0.145,0.9904

Don't rely solely on what google may tell you or on lawyer advises. It cost some effort, but as a future employer you better know the laws yourself on this topic. As I'm in France the law is published on the web. It is thus easier to do. Don't know what the situation is in the US and your state.

One major difference for me is that when you make a change while coding, you can see instantly what the difference is; there's no delay.  In cooking, you often have to wait for minutes after a change to see if it was a good change.  But after thinking about that, it dawns on me that cooking <i>is</i> like coding, if you're using a language that requires a separate compile step.  I've always avoided those languages (all my experience is in interpreted languages, except for CL, which still has no requirement for a length compile step).Anyway, less fancifully, I think there's a culture difference, here.  If you grew up in a house where there was always a hundred things you could nuke for breakfast, why would you ever learn to cook unless you were especially interested in one dish that had to be cooked?  Lastly, I was a nerd when growing up, and we were pretty much the poorest people in the trailer park.

I don't think you can use IQ as a lever in this regard.2)  Even if 1) is incorrect, the IQ curve has a normal distribution. So, you'd cut off most of your users pretty quickly as your IQ requirements get higher.  Last time I checked, it is a bad idea to actively trim a large chunk of people from your community.  Especially by effectively telling them that they're 'too stupid'....3)  I'd be willing to bet that you'd alienate an important subset of people - intelligent mavericks, who wouldn't care to be part of some club based on a number.  And I'd also be willing to bet that theirs are the viewpoints that would probably make your site interesting enough to come back to.4)  Adding onerous requirements (even if they are periodic) to allow people to contribute would probably result in a huge falloff in participation, and not just by the 'low IQ' club...

I agree with some of the comments here that suggest that a lot of people might feel alienated. It would probably work to abstract out the IQ of the user from the user himself. This means NOT having an IQ test per se and instead using relevant data mining techniques to measure the knowledge of the user based off of the user's posts and the rating that the user receives. I guess knowledge is a more relevant criteria for most people to read a given post, unless you expect someone to solve/crack a problem, rather than add content. But, at the same time, if the metric (could call it IQ or KQ??)) can be internalized, and used to group people together and in turn used to attract people falling under a given group, might be valuable. A notion of relative IQ (of groups) would probably be more relevant here. (Creating an e-harmony for people in the same group and cater to their needs based on a given metric)I also agree that this will apply better in a domain specific platform more than other generic social content platforms, simply because it would be easier to measure a given user metric. So, it needs to be as domain specific as possible. Is anyone working on this kind of a model? Definitely an interesting problem!!!",1176140746,,comment,,0.039,0.86,0.102,0.9394

It makes it really easy to think about the problem. You serve a page, the page has actions (method calls) which take parameters. The parameters are fields on the page. It's really easy to think about an application. It lets you prototype in code.For our stuff, I started with rails, just found it too hard to get started. I had to decide what the tables looked like, how I was going to divide the data, write a model for every table then connect it to a page. With UCW, I write code which connects to a function call. Simple.

I knew it was a measurement of some sort(hey what else can a number be?) but I'd no idea about what exactly having ""more karma"" means.My point is that when you use such phrases, you are assuming a specific kind of audience. Use of karma for reddit(tech-focused) is fine; even for news.yc it's fine -  but for a consumer website, you should be very careful about introduction of new words. And say you love the word karma so much that you insist on using it - in that case, have a page that clearly explains what karma is assuming that the user knows nothing about it.Karma is just one example - larger point here is to be careful about use of individual words that may have a huge role to play in your website. Thing that triggered me to make this post is I saw another poster use ""karma"" on their consumer start-up(bad idea IMO). This is a mistake that is so easy to commit. Heck we did it when we launched.

The question is - what types of data storage of the web going to be? - what is the sql or retrieval method of the web? - what are the tools to interact?- what factors influence storage?Also with storage it relies on bandwidth. What is the law on bandwidth? It's not like Moore`s law and relies on external forces beyond mere commodity markets.  Well luck has it that there's Nielsen`s law [1] describing the increase of bandwidth per year, around 50%.

Paul has a lot of tough choices to make and I understand his reasons for using comments as one of the many tools in filtering prospective startups, but I really hope its a small small factor.  Sure it proves I read blogged advice and other mumbo jumbo on the subject of startups and am interested in the funding, but it also might indicate that a person has way too much free time or has a serious net addiction (a major development killer).  I've been getting ready to kick start my startup this summer for over a month now.  During that time I've read a lot of these startup articles, all of Paul's entries, Founders at Work, bought a few other books and searched the net for VC firms and how to get in touch with them.  One article at the beginning of the process affected me greatly.  When I was making the tough decision to do the startup or take a very appealing job offer I read Paul's article (not to brown nose) ""A student's guide to startups"" which said the best time to start one is when you're 24, fresh out of grad school, and hopefully have a solid internship behind you.  That was something I didn't know and hit me hard because this summer that will be my exact situation. If I hadn't have read it I might have missed my perfect window! I made my decision right then. Every article, book, or resource since however has been repetitive and more draining on my energy to get started than helpful.My point, and the article's author's point in the quoted paragraph is, use these articles to get yourself inspired and confident about  doing this thing and then stop reading and commenting!  You're inspired now don't kill it and waste your time with reading more and more of the same crap, go make your own stories. This is most likely my last post here.

BrandonM,,,,11115,[11121],10656.0,1525543619,,"Wow, this is obviously the viewpoint of someone who is not at all familiar with gift societies, someone who seems to me to be desperately clinging to a dogmatism in order to convince him- or herself that his or her life has been lived in a moral manner.  The truth is that it's not all black and white.  Socialist != Evil, and Capitalist != Good.You speak of corporations bringing happiness to people, but I would like to point out something that I heard a month or so ago.  It used to be that people had necessities and very basic desires which were fulfilled by entrepreneurs (merchants and guildworkers) in a capitalist system.  In the present-day US and several other countries, however, that is no longer the case.  Companies used to be in the business of manufacturing goods to fulfill needs.  Nowadays, they instead manufacture needs to sell goods.  Why do you think advertising is such a huge industry?It's all kind of funny when you consider the cycle.  The current corporate structure relies on a large amount of drone workers doing the majority of the work for a small cut of the pay.  The only way to make these workers do this work that no one in their right mind would do willingly is to pay them.  Why do they need that money?  To buy the very things that these corporations are telling them that they need to be buying.  It's all a crazy, vicious cycle, and I'm afraid that it is the inevitable result of long-term capitalist societies.  Do you see anything changing for the better in these regards?In an Anthropology class a few years ago, we talked about studies that some researchers had done in comparing the lives of people in developed countries to hunter-gatherer tribes in South America and Africa.  The people in these tribes typically spent 2-3 hours a day to provide their food and shelter, and the rest of the time was spent chatting, telling stories, singing, dancing, sporting, and other tribal activities.  I would argue that <i>that</i> is happiness, not going to work 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week so that I can get a new car that gets me to work more comfortably.To compare Open Source software to development at gunpoint is absurd.  If I have an interesting idea for a piece of software that I would like to write, I am going to write the software and be very happy to share it with the open source community.  This has nothing to do with violence; I have enjoyed the benefits of a completely free computing system with extensive functionality, and I am quite happy to return the favor.  This is known as a gift society, not violent, immoral ideologies.And this money-for-happiness equation that you are promoting looks a lot like pie in the sky.  I worked for 2 years for a small grocer in a country gas station / food mart.  The store had been in his family for something like 40 years, and he served a valuable need to the surrounding community in providing the only gas and groceries for 20 miles around.  He and his wife worked long days and were by no means rich, but they made enough to live on.  His regular customers knew him by name, and he was a regular bidder at the 4-H auctions every summer.  Clearly, in this case, the exchange of money for goods is happy for everyone.  Unfortunately, cutthroat companies like Wal-Mart move into town who have no concern for the well-being of the community, doing things like storing materials in parking lots which poison water supplies during rain, avoiding a golf cart security guard in their parking lot even though it has proven to reduce crime to 0%, relying on federal programs to cover worker health benefits, and driving all local businesses out and then moving out when the profit margins are no longer good.  So the customers save money, yes, but they lose out in so many other ways.  This is the problem with faceless corporations who do not see things at a human level.In summary, my problem is not with capitalism, and I am not a socialist.  I merely fear that the inevitable end of capitalism is the type of corporate society that has been steadily evolving in the U.S. and elsewhere, one in which paper and numbers are more important than people.",1176180881,,comment,,0.076,0.751,0.173,0.998

IF you have a %15 chance of building a company worth $20M in 2 years, and you'll get $2M of that-- then the opportunty value is 0.15X2M or $300,000. On the other hand, if you bootstrap, and you build the same business, your chances of being a success go up to %60 (No flatline VC sitting on your board forcing bad decisions) but maybe you spend a bit less on marketing and grow more organically (really, I'm being generous here- I think the same business would grow just as fast bootstrapped.) so you end up being worth $10M in two years.  Your share of that is $5M, for an opportunity value of $3,000,000.In other words, you're likely to return ten times the money by forgoing venture capital. While in both cases you could end up with nothing, weighting the payoff with the likihood of success lets you evaluate two very different opportunities.If you take the choice tht has a %15 chance of success, odds are you won't get that first million... where as in the alternative, odds are you <i>will</i>.

Not even prime flagships of economy, which of BitGeek knows about, weren't able to undermine one simple sentence from Marx's ""Das Kapital"" - Only (human) labour and labour only can produce new value. Not money - labour. There is no need, I presume, to point out the quantity of labour pumped into the ""market""  since early 1990's on radically different principals then ones driving the dead.Another view could also come from the economy principals. Shortly it is a story of smart and dumb monopols. The smart ones optimize the production level - the dumb ones optimize the profit. The dead rocketed profit (and extra-profit) sky high.Personally I do not thik that the future is in web-based IT.

Is it a coincidence a Web 2.0 investor supports an evangelically blinkered approach to non Web 2.0 solutions.I am a fantastic believer in history telling us about the future.  And in this case, history says, Microsoft will always be key to a desktop centric world.  And desktop centricity is cyclical.  For now Web 2.0 seems to have the baton, but as we nove into a very rich multi-media world we will become constrained by the broadband pipes.  This will push apps, content, and everything else back to the user device, be it a Windows PC or a Windows Pocket PC.  Apple stole the march with the single purpose iPod (don't pretend video or anything else on the iPod is a killer App), but Microsoft still own the multi-purpose device.DRM has been the Achilles Heel of Microsoft.  As they have come back from many Anti-Trust cases they attempted to sidestep more brouhaha in the world of Digital Media, and have attempted to play fair (don't get me wrong I know they usually do not play fair).  This has allowed Apple to gain the upperhand in Music Devices.  But, as Apple are now breaking the mold on this to allow DRM-free sales from EMI, they in turn will have just given Microsoft the opening it will need to reinforce its position.  It wont be success through intent, as I believe that the Zune player will fail.  But a new competitive ecosystem of devices will lead everything back to the desktop as the hub.No matter what, no-one is going to trust their personal memories, be it music, video or photo's entirely to the Web.  They will share it there, but not leave it there.Microsoft is back where they were when Netscape first launched, they are the slow lumbering laggard.But as history shows us, they turned themselves around, and owned (however briefly) the mindset of everyone who had money to spend (and this is not typically your 15-year old Web 2.0 consumer with no money), it was the corporates, with their large cheque books.Google are moving more and more to follow the Microsoft lead.  Microsoft is far from dead, but like all parents who have given life to others (such as Google, albeit through removed ways), they from time to time will be less involved in their Children's lives.  But, they will always retain some criticality in their lives.  MS will never really die in our lifetimes.  They just move from being the soul point of attention.Good luck to your startups, but imagining them operating in a world where they do not know and respect the importance of Microsoft, and try to emulate or utilise them in their goals, seems like a recipe for failure to me.

It is also quite true that hardware and stuff are quite cheap by now.Still, if you don't have any money and not a job then VC seems to be the only way on how to make a living and pay for all the expenses. There are lawyer fees for getting incorporated, trademark-fees, patent-fees and renting a scalable RoR server at JoyEnt costs also 125$ a month. We are now a team of three founders and work fulltime on our project. But programming is only half the things we have to do, we also have to think about the promotion of our product, things have to be designed, the userinterface gets tested a lot and we have to think about strategies how to make our service known. We will probably use GoogleAdWords, create a viral videospot etc. All these things cost money. And it would be really great to have an office where we could program instead of my 13 squaremeter room which leaves me nearly no privacy because when I go to bed someone is programming in my apartment and when I wake up someone else is already there.Therefore I think that VC still covers a quite basic need of a startup, even if RoR is used and the founders have read Getting Real.

With Apple being percieved as strong, Microsoft can not be suide as easily for anything they do to control or manipulate the market. Deffinately they are not publicly viewed as a Manopoly any more. Take a close look from this direction and you may find another good article to write. What has helped the market more than Apple or Linux is this: desktop applications have standardized and the conversion tools make even programs like excell (with macros and arrays) interchangable with other nock off products. Thanks goes to the unknowns that supply open source that is interchangeable with MS products. If this was not avaialble every business would be locked into one desktop and that would likely still be MS Office.

jwecker,,,,11225,,10969.0,1525543635,,"btw, HOP uses the Bigaloo web server and so isn't quite adequate apparently for a high traffic site (like I assume most here will have).  here's an email exchange I had with the author the other day- sorry if the comment's a bit big:I apologize for such a late answer. I'm always fighting with email. I'm
definitively not good at it because I'm not able to answer at a decent pace. Hi Manuel. I've just been playing with Hop. Well done. It's just
 beautiful. A couple of questions about it:
 first, the bigloo web server- is this completely necessary? I guess one
 of 4 things would need to happen for hop to be totally ideal:
 <i> Bigloo implements light-weight threads Gambit-scheme style so that it
 can have erlang-like load capacity (
 <a href=""http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html"">http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html</a> ) (most preferable option,
 IMO, though I have no idea what your feelings are here. To me this
 would make bigloo light-years ahead of all other scheme imps.)
I have tried several things concerning the multi-threading. You can read
our FairThreads proposal (<a href=""http://www.inria.fr/mimosa/Manuel.Serrano)."">http://www.inria.fr/mimosa/Manuel.Serrano).</a>
When I did this study I though that FairThreads was a decent solution.
Now that's no longer clear to me. Hop does not use Fair threads but
Posix like threads. I'm quite aware of all the troubles that come with
this kind of threads. I have not considered an Erlang-like solution
yet but that's something I could envision. </i> Get hop to work with a gambit-scheme server instead of bigloo (where
 would i start with this? can you point me to relevant points in the
 code?)
No, I think that you cannot. Hop is really not a portable Scheme
program. It extensively relies on Bigloo features. I'm afraid that
you will have to rewrite entirely. It's not a huge program but it is
not that small either. The problem is that it uses a lot of libraries
that you would have to re-implement too. All in all it's about 40.000
lines of Scheme code. I don't really recommend to try to re-implement
that (except if you are very brave ;-) <i> Get hop to work with mod_lisp (less preferable, IMO)
No. I don't think that a solution too. Hop needs to be running
permanently. That is two successive requests must be handled in the
same execution environment (i.e., the first request may set a global
variable that is read by the second request). Hence, even if you want
to use Apache you will be forced to have a server running somewhere
and you will have to establish a communication between Apache and that
server. Why not directly using Hop as a server? Second item is the overall latency and possible redundancy... actually, I
 don't know how to phrase the problem- but it boils down to this, I
 counted over 27 distinct ""connecting to server"" cycles when you click
 on the ""weblets"" tab of the Hop Home page. It took quite a while
 re-establishing the connection to the server 27 times. Are there
 thoughts on overcoming this?
Not really but... First, the Hop server supports keep-alive connections.
This should help. Then, honestly, I have hoped to find time to optimize
the server for months. I have not found that time yet but I think that I will
have it around the end of Spring. At that moment, I will study the problem
you are mentioning.However, I'm using Hop on a daily basis. Even more, in order to push it to
its limits, I'm using it as my regular proxy. That is all my HTTP connections,
on all my machines, go through a Hop proxy/server. The performance are
acceptable. That is, I'm not annoyed by an important slow down due to Hop. Thanks again!!
You are welcome. Thanks for the encouragements.--

If any buyer, even Microsoft, offered the sort of environment I wanted to work in, plus enough money that I could walk away and not need to work another corporate IT job again if the environment changed, I'd sell.And some of this is predicated on the experience of a good friend of mine, whose team mostly bootstrapped a very profitable company, then sold it to their largest corporate customer; suddenly they were getting guaranteed salaries, and they got to watch their project earn tens of millions in revenue, but the working environment was politically toxic and the company (now a wholly-owned subsidiary) was the football in constant turf wars, and (in retrospect, especially after seeing the first two years' income from the project) the price they asked was about 1/10 of what it should have been.I can't alter the turf wars and political toxicity in certain corporations, but I can make sure I ask a price for my company that means I can stand up and walk away with no financial worries if they develop.

We have money only for cheap hardware (forget macbook), broadband, and maybe some for hosting. These trends represent the future: 4/5 of world population the chinese, indian, arabs, or latinos won't have more money to spend going online.From this entire business scene only Google is able to get money from us. We are willing to pay only for Google Ads because they are cheap, straight, and delivers ROI next minute.We go connected for nothing, we create for nothing and we get revenue by partnering Google.Any other company who does not follow this business model is, or will be dead.
Nobody ever will pay for any tools to create an online business but we will share our revenue with who generates us profit.

Ajax-y web apps show the potential for ignoring platform specific APIs (such as Win32)--especially when you don't try to mimic platform specific behaviour (the big problem with Swing-based apps: stop pretending to be a native desktop app! Rejoice in being a x-platform web app!).

Furthermore, 90% of our communication is done with our body. If we are suspicious and judgemental of new people, they will read this in how we move and posture, and respond in kind, resulting in the precise situation we are trying to avoid. This doesn't mean to ignore warning signs, but to focus primarily on whether this person is willing to collaborate and compromise with you as you work towards your goals.

zach,,,,11369,,11004.0,1525543656,,"I liked the Brad Bird interview, but I was totally blown away by the Spline Doctors' podcast with Andrew Stanton.  I was like, yeah, the Nemo guy, I guess he's a writer... okay, so I didn't know his backstory with Pixar or anything about him and it just was an amazing interview to me.Anyway, I wanted to explain the emphasis I put on just how much you want to really desire to create what you're making, to be dying to get it in front of people.  So here's the part I wanted to excerpt from the interview that really gives you folks in News.YC-land the sense of how driven you want to be:---Interviewer Andrew Gordon: What would you say is the hardest thing about directing an animated movie?Andrew Stanton: The hardest thing about directing an <i>animated</i> movie is keeping yourself excited about it.  It's hard enough to make the crew excited about it, but keeping yourself excited about it -- trying to remind yourself why you wanted to do it.  Because it's all about the details once you really start making the movie.It's no different than building a house, or, building a really extravagant mansion.  There's a million details that you have to spend more time with after the bigger ideas of where the rooms are going to go and how it's going to be structured, and it can get you kind of bogged down.Joe Ranft used to have this great expression that there's always a point during the making of a movie where there's sort of the Columbus where-is-the-land moment, where everybody on the boat is going ""You promised us the land.  Where's the land?  We're not seeing it!""And people get bogged down in all the minor problems or the major problems that won't go away, and it's all justified -- it's all legitimate to have that response.So, for me, to prevent that is to get really, really picky about what story you're going to tell up front.  And this is my opinion, and it's not a rule.  But if I have an idea that I kinda like, then I don't want to do it.  If I have an idea that affects every fiber of my being, like ""I want to see that movie made whether I make it or not"" -- it's like that idea <i>has</i> to get on the screen -- that's a real good quality to start with.  Because it's going to get attacked for the next four years.  And there's going to be, sometimes, weeks or months where nothing seems to be going right.[...]It's like looking for oil or something -- it's like ""where can I find something that has enough fuel that's going to keep me going for years?""  Because there's going to large stretches of time where nothing is working, nobody's happy, everybody thinks that the sky is going to fall, and what's going to get me out of bed is just because that idea still <i>has</i> to be on the screen.So I want that when I'm going to go into battle.  Because it's going to be battle.  So if I don't have that going in, then I won't go into it -- I won't make that movie.  And I'm starting to try and insist on that with other filmmakers here at Pixar, because I just know the benefits of it.",1176226842,,comment,,0.037,0.826,0.137,0.9954

Is it not a wonder that those kids who walk to the beat of their own drum in school becomes successful and those who always followed the rules become great paper pushers?  That's what school does, it teaches us to seek an approval that's external to us (ie. teacher's approval, grades, awards) and not a sense of internal approval (ie. pride, enjoyment, satisfaction).  We all get at least nearly 2 decades of this socialization process to be pounded into a mold (whether we're round, or rectangle or rhombus, we're all going into that square hole, because that's the only way to succeed in school, and if we don't, we're deemed a freak and forced to be medicated and the like).  It's that same mold that we must break free from if we're to draw into the inner creativity, that inner peace.

You can't (I've read) effortlessly connect small, well-designed, single-purpose programs together with things like pipes, redirection, etc. And, most programs by default (again, I've read) are inextricably attached to their GUIs, so you can't make them scriptable like you can with a command-line Unix tool plus a shell script.

By that they have gone through a process of accepting other people's technological advances and by incorporating them into their infrastructure and overall corporate culture they will slowly try to regain their old status.It would be a nice move, however, to give them the death blow by asking them, in court, how many LOC of open source software they have included in their past projects by simply rewriting the existing code?

Please don't take it personally, because most of the proposals we
rejected, we rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the
quality of the applicants.  For example, we were very reluctant to
accept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting
a startup is too much work for one person.  We also had a higher
threshold for applicants who were still in school, groups where one
or more members planned to keep their current jobs, and groups that
couldn't all move to Boston.  We rejected a lot of proposals simply
because we couldn't understand them, or didn't understand the problem
domain well enough to judge them, or because the project seemed too
big to start on only three months of funding.  Sometimes we even
rejected good ideas, because another group proposed the same idea

I submitted my application on April 6th after I specifically nulled out my entire application before because I didn't want to be in Boston this summer, because I got an e-mail that said ""you had started an application but never clicked Submit.  Please go in and submit it.""  When I went via the special link in the e-mail, I saw that half of my application was still there, even though I specifically had previously deleted each field and saved it blank because I didn't want to apply or to share my information.  So, I said, what the heck, they contacted me, and it seems my details were recovered from their database even though I deleted the fields, and I could say I was special if I both got in and had applied late on the 6th via a special e-mail link, so that made it interesting; so, I clicked Submit.   I'm also a single founder who has a pre-existing corporation, so I guess I struck out on all the important fields that matter. :P  Finally, I also knew from some post here that they say ""please laugh at us if we were wrong to reject you"", so I knew that even if I received such a letter, it would be fun to take them up on the offer. :PThe best part about YC, and one I will always be thankful for, is the chance to attend the Startup School.  So, whether you are specifically selected for YC or not, it's good that there are many entrepreneurial peers in Cambridge and Mountain View who you can associate with, thanks to YC.  Second, the articles on this site.  Third, this news.ycombinator.com web site.  Fourth, meeting great people.The 5K+5K per person is great regardless of whether you are selected or not.  I'm rooting for as many teams as possible get selected, versus for any one specific team, because we all benefit from a huge number of peer startups, regardless of who specifically it is.  It's very lonely for those who aren't in those startup hotspots, and news.yc does something in additional to PG's articles--allows people to feel like they're part of the scene in YC, whether they are selected for YC or move to one of those areas themselves, without feeling like strangers.

That is what hurts. Maybe you can take a step back today and take a look at what you are doing and ask yourself ""How can I make better, more simple and scale it?"" or ""How can we make people see that this is better than other products out there and a business can be built around it?"" because if you believe it is great, than maybe you fail to present it the proper way. 
 Take the rest of the day off. Get a drink, socialize, shut that computer down and relax. Tomorrow your head will be clear and you can start working on your startup again. Not because it will make you a millionaire, or because it will get you respect, but just because that is what you love to do and without it your Puzzle is just not complete.

I guess you will have to wait until March. :)Actually, everybody always says a.s.a.p.  Most people think they're competing against ""people who will rip me off as soon as I release my product"" which leads to conclusions of ""if I release on day X, I will be ripped off Y number of days later, so I should wait until Z, the perfect time, to release.""  In fact, there's a higher chance that there are startups and current companies doing something similar REGARDLESS of YOU.A lot of the reason existing companies have not caught on to idea X is because the whole reason you have idea Y is because the current companies just came out with idea X and there's simply no way to do Y before X.  So, they may have already had your idea Y in mind, or started working on it, but had to release X first.  So, when you got your idea, so did employees of all of these other companies, as well as budding entrepreneurs.  So, you should release and at least get credit for being first.  The whole point of being a startup is you can create whatever there's a huge chance big companies are working on as well, but much faster because you're just implementing basic features and avoiding bureacracy, as well as have no responsibilities.  So, if you're trying to do a startup PG-style, I would try to create it and release it as soon as it works, with the bare features in it, and get publicity about it.I'm sure there are other mantras, like targeting a very small niche and improving the product, and only publicizing it when its ready (but you have tons of feedback from your small niche).  Or, maybe getting a lot of venture capital straight off and partnering with big shots after you're much older and have many contacts.  But I think if you're doing it PG-style (and I don't speak for him), you should release it as soon as it works.  More or less.",1176243397,,comment,,0.027,0.853,0.12,0.9829

Stuzo,,,,11579,[11840],11577.0,1525543687,,"So, I did not get an interview.  The purpose of me entering was to network and connect with possible team members for my current project.  I am a non technical founder who has gone at it with a team of hired individuals.  I am a business guy at heart and understand tech from a product and design standpoint better than most, but I cant write code.   I have invested over $100k of my own money into the project.  I am looking to bring on board two rockstar programmers as cofounders. The site is www.stuzo.com.  We currently have close to 7,000 community members and the site has some revenues.  The site was originally launched as an intercampus textbook exchange that enabled college students to buy and sell online and then to meet on campus for the exchange.  The model and the site have gone through a complete overhaul over the past 6 months.   The new site just went live today.  We are tidying things up this week and will begin a grassroots on/offline marketing campaign next week.   My goal is to connect people through the media they own, love, and want.  There is still a lot of work that needs to be done to build out the vision.  Check out the site and drop me a line if you like what you see. You can reach me via aim/gtalk/skype.  My name for all is stuzoguy.

FritFrut,,,,11600,,11404.0,1525543690,,"Hm, ok, I guess I was a bit harsh, so I apologize... however, availability of certain tools/languages on Linux really depends on the distribution and what options you install. Perl is probably installed everywhere, but others are not. Also, all the major languages are very well supported on Windows (I've been using Perl on Windows since '97 or so, and lots of people are using Python and Ruby lately). .NET framework is free and includes libraries, documentation, tools and compilers. There are a lots of editors (including vi and emacs). Also, there's free Visual Studio express, etc. Granted, they are not included with Windows installation, but I guess that's because of the difference in distribution and licensing models, rather than some fundamental inability of Windows platform to include them.About the support for the hackers... hm... it probably depends on the definition of 'hacker', but there's MSDN, a HUGE resource for the developers on the Windows platforms, with references for all products, languages and tools, examples, knowledge base etc.Speaking of installation, I guess it's a matter of preference. Personally, I prefer to download stuff that I need, burn the 'developer tools dvd', and install from there. apt, urpmi and similar tools are nice and I quite like their elegance and simplicity, but they are great when you have enough bandwidth and don't have to pay for the extra traffic, and not so nice if you have 3-4 machines to install or update.And, finally, yes... hackers are few and far between, developers are a bit more common, and the rest are coders.

Forums2.) Startup profiles - list your logo, demo URL, description, launch status (pre-launch/launched), and maybe a few other fields.  Linked to the user profiles of each founder.3.) ""Demo groups"" of 10-12 startups, randomly assigned but ideally with a preference for placing startups in the same city together.  Each demo group has a private forum and an area for news, feature releases, announcements, etc..  Each feature release has threaded comments for discussion and rapid feedback.  Demo groups are expected to be each other's support mechanism, and give each other rapid feedback on new changes.  For startups that are pre-launch, only people in the same demo group can see what you're up to.  (If you want <i>nobody</i> to see what you're doing, perhaps you shouldn't register it on a website...)4.) Karma, based on how many feature releases a team has put out lately and how many people click through to their startup based on that.

YC is three months of funding.  IF you make $25 an hour, you can work a three month contract and save up enough to fund yourself for three months to try and get a prototype done.  You can totally focus on the project for those three months.  If you can only get a 6 month contract, then do it, and you'll have 6 months to work on your idea.Also, you're assuming that doing your startup on the side ""massively decreases your chance of success"".  I think this is in error-- success is goverened by determination more than anything else, and someone who builds something on the side is clearly determined. Personally, its more fun to focus on your project completely, and so, its probably psychologically better to work for 3 or 6 months, and then take a 3 or 6 month ""break"".

The fact that Google docs hasn't really clicked just points to the fact that certain software makes sense to be offline. One reason why; user sometimes wants to be very close to his data.The key to the future i believe is the right mix of offline and online capabilities in applications. Microsoft has been kind of late in putting offline capabilities to many of its products. But that doesn't mean they are dead; they have the resources and ability to create paradigm shifts in this business. The fact that a person like Ray Ozzie (who is more or less associated with network computing and collaboration) is now overlooking the software giant's product teams also sends indications that Microsoft will start looking into the online/offline match. Infact the concept of ""internet services disrupted"", term coined by Ray Ozzie in a recent talk, precisely shows the direction in which Microsoft is headed.

The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.""I think this pretty much disputes Paul's notion that Jobs' being fired from Apple was somehow a bad thing. It was bad in the sense that the people who took over nearly destroyed Apple, but it also set-up the conditions for a reborn Jobs to return and make the company into what it is today.",1176275967,,comment,,0.073,0.671,0.256,0.9986

Is it what users want, NOW? For me this is a need as I have lots of distributed stuff over 10 years but for newer users most of their stuff is in a database, CMS etc. The market is short sited in this respect. From what I can tell there is a distinct lack of demand. All the top level blogs are platform focused (blogger, wordpress, typepad, mt). These services are so good they don't seem to go down, thus where's the need?It's a good idea btw, because if you own your own data you become the definitive source. BTW how are you solving the following problems?- extracting data from services with no API?- extracting data from services with API's (have to do coding for each service)- problem of input? Service side input & extraction via API v's Client side input and exporting via API's (if the content is yours)- How do you visualise the mixing of data?- Which (key) services do you concentrate on extracting data? Or is it any service? They key things I got out of thinking making a biz out of this particular idea is that you can get into problems ...- focus on individual users and miss out any network effects (user foo connects to user bar).- not creating a new market - restricting sales by creating a secondary market because users use other services to create and yours (if needed or others) to backup.So while I'm still building this tool, I'll be looking at areas in this space that I can extract the best/better value (something that people want, faster, savings in time & effort etc) and looking for new ideas associated (and new)  while solving this particular problem space for me.

Rejection from YC can mean that they don't think the project can succeed; it can also mean that they don't think the project, even if it succeeds, will give them the kind of return on investment they want.So (to make the math easy) suppose they have a company that they own 10% of, that they've invested $15K in.  This means that for them to break even, the company has to eventually have a value of $150,000.  A rule of thumb for business valuation is that the sale price of the business is 3 to 5 times its annual earnings -- which means that the business has to earn $30,000 a year to $50,000 a year in profit for that to be worthwhile.Now, a micro-ISV, for instance, that treats its founders' salaries (appropriately) as expenses may be a terrifically successful business from the point of view of the founders, especially if they pay themselves acceptably well and like the working conditions.  But unless it makes $30,000 to $50,000 in profits a year, it's a losing proposition for Y Combinator.There are other ways it can be a winning proposition without those profits -- if it's just before the tipping point of a big trend, or if the founders are especially skillful.  A company that isn't making any profits at the moment but has the potential to make really big profits, or the potential to be sold for a lot of money, might be a worthwhile investment.",1176304084,,comment,,0.018,0.851,0.131,0.9752

A lot of sites try to give a taste of every bit of functionality on the front page, but it doesn't work well.  Which do you go to: Google or Yahoo?

All you have to worry about is giving a link to your customers to pay you via PayPal and you have the cash. The big disadvantage of PayPal is lack of control; they can hold your cash at anytime and big as they are it can be a while before you get it sorted out. Additionally you are very limited as far as how much you can customize the payment page. Now with the paypal api I think you have more control than when I used em.Now lets talk about the real cc processing setup. It involves three parties: merchant, gateway, signing bank. Usually, when you signup with a merchant they will set you up with the bank they have a deal with so you can accept credit cards. The gateway is authorize.net. Authorize.net will be the interface between your customer's CC info and the bank that actually does the transaction.Ideally for long-term you'd want to use a real merchant. But for starters, paypal should be a good option for you.

elialfordj,,,,12049,,12010.0,1525543755,,"I've researched both paypal and authorize.net pretty thoroughly. For starters, I ended up with authorize.net. To first compare features though: Paypal offers what I believe they call the ""paylink"" feature. This is where the user is redirected to a paypal site (off of your own website) to make their purchase. The good thing about this for retail driven commerce is that it will interface well with a shopping cart system. I believe it either has no monthly charge or a very minimal one (also you won't need your own SSL). Above this, both companies have an API (or an application programming interface). To use Paypal's API you need to subscribe to their ""payflow pro"" program. This is about $40-50 mo. Authorize.net has API integration for about $30 I think. But then you need a merchant bank account which you can get through them for another $10. For those who aren't familiar, through an API you can set up a payment system that is built into your own site, which relays the data to the payment gateway. This is obviously the best option for serious merchants of any kind.When accepting credit cards you'll also need a SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or in other words a secure connection (https://). I think they will actually allow you to use their api without that but it's definitely a horrible idea. There are a few major providers of this service, and they range in price significantly. www.InstantSSL.com or ""Comodo"" as they call themselves, has a pretty decent mid range SSL encryption package for about $100 a year. Godaddy.com has one that's like 19.99 or something ridiculous. The issue with SSL providers is simple. You can bet that they are all perfectly secure. The issue is really in browser recognition. The worst thing ever for an online merchant is to loose credibility, and what's the fastest way to appear disreputable - """"this site may not be secure, internet explorer recommends that you leave it immediately"" or what ever that error says. This happens when a browser doesn't recognize the security certificate. To be safe, go with a provider that you can guarantee is trusted by all the major browsers (even old versions).Also - one last piece of advice. When subscribing for a SSL certificate make SURE to turn your domain anonymity off temporairly while you subscribe. Otherwise they'll put you through an endless ""verification"" process that involves multiple faxes and endless bureaucracy!!!

Talk to your current bank to see if they have an arm that deals with merchant accounts.  Most banks that offer business accounts either have their own or partner with a third party to provide the services to customers.  Note that you will need an SSL certificate if you go with a merchant account.  Id recommend VeriSign ( they will also most likely end up being your Payment Gateway if you do decide to set up your own merchant account).  Their SSL certificates are a bit pricy, but the most trusted name in the business.   You want to make sure you get a low processing fee (percent of the transaction that the bank ends up taking  shoot for under 2% and a low per transaction fee (shoot for 20 cents or lower  hard to find).

When I did get into the ivory tower and started teaching, I became disgusted with the academic mentality and was fortunate enough to find my way out into my own startup with a ""good"" problem, and contacts to customers.The CS/CmpE degrees taught me irreplaceable critical thinking skills.  I regret not having even thought about the possibility of starting my own gig.  I also regret not having developed or appreciated developing a network of contacts until I was in my 30s; I have found access to investors, entrepreneurs, etc. as not only wonderful from a pragmatic perspective, but also (and more importantly) for vetting out ideas.

I think the tag cloud is self explanatory in the sense, the font of the individual tags depends on the amount of content under a particular tag. It's a visual representation of the category system where the amount of content in each is represented by a number in brackets in front of each category. 
Both these techniques have their own pros and cons as one is more visual while the other asks the user to find out where he wants to go. 
I think a combination of both might be the optimum solution, where the content is provided under tags which are pretty broad and category and sub category takes the user deeper and is more useful for users who are looking for specific information.",1176332026,,comment,,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.8399

They exist.  They aren't as cool as YC, but they have money and they have connections, too.  As a last resort, if you're in the wrong city for raising money (anything other than Silicon Valley or Boston), warm up your credit card and give it a go.  You can live for three months on a credit card (I've done it several times...I'm on my second company, the first being self-funded and sometimes credit card funded).  Obviously, if you've got a family to support the ""warm up your credit card"" method of funding is right out.

Freelancers are professionals and need income like everybody else.  You may not be able to offer market rates, so do what you can in-house, and make reasonable offers for the things you need to outsource.2. Beg for favors from family and friends.  With people you know well, you <i>can</i> get away with asking for favors for little or no remittance.  It becomes a team effort.  Of course, your friends' goodwill is a limited resource.  Spend it wisely.  If a graphic designer friend makes a logo for your company, and you lose interest two weeks later, she won't be as willing to help on your next project.3. Be persuasive.  There are great ways to get people to help you out, and you can learn to pitch your request so that it sounds better than ""just based on promises."" ;-)  I'm not an expert on this, but two books that get rave reviews are ""The Psychology of Persuasion"" and ""Getting to Yes"".  You can persuade people to help you out if you know how to ask.  Make it a win-win situation.I don't suggest offering equity to contractors right off the bat.  A friend who will work for equity will probably also work for free, with just a few tokens of your appreciation.  And if you're asking someone to do so much work that they <i>need</i> some compensation, maybe they should be a co-founder?Nor do I suggest getting services on loan.  (""We'll pay you once we're funded."")  Investors want you to use their capital to do new work and achieve new milestones, not pay off old debt.  Employees get impatient when they're owed money.

  First of all, sorry I didn't reply you in my previous YC post. I was going to but got sidetracked looking in the startup hub thing.  Thank you for the advice.  To me Burlingame is not far at all from SF.  I was thinking I'm forgoing all the south bay people since it's quite a drive from down there.  But from SF, it isn't too far, especially when this location is right off the 101 freeway exit.  But more importantly, I was not really trying to suit everyone.  Actually, yes, I _was_ trying to suit most people at first.  But after not getting much replies, I figure I had to go a different route.  I figure that I may have to choose a location first, and then let them decide if that's what they want.   So I try to look at different locations available and imagine what I can do with the space.  Once I can imagine what I can do with it (how I can setup and divide up the space), I let everyone know about it.  Those who happen to be close to that location will be ""lucky"".  Those who aren't will have to decide whether they want to make the commute or try to setup carpooling or forget about it.  So if this location doesn't work out (still not too much response so far), I'll see what the next location brings.  That may be in SF or further south.  Hope you get a better idea of what I'm trying to do here.oh, yes, this Burlingame location is right between 2 Bart stations, but I won't call them close by since it's like 1 mile away from each station.thanks again for the reply,

themotie,,,,12187,[16651],10656.0,1525543775,,"You seem to labor under a few misconceptions.Sure, you CAN make money while bringing happiness to the people. As long as it doesn't touch you bottom line, that is. There is a landmark legal case from 1916 (Dodge vs Ford), that's now codified in most countries, that's illustrative of corporations priorities. Ford (the man) wanted to use some of his company's huge profits to do good and make the customers happy. He paid his workers more than the going rate and reduced the price on the company's cars. He figured his company wouldn't have been where it was if it hadn't been for his customers. So this was a way for him to say ""thank you"" and be a responsible community citizen.He got sued by some of Ford's (the company) stock holders, who argued that Ford (the man) had no business giving away their money, however good his intentions, and however happy the customers (in this case) would be. The stock holders won handily, and Ford (the man) was severely rebuked by the judge. So the law nowadays expressly forbids companies to do anything that may jeopardize the bottom line and the stock owners dividends.Of course, companies can make people happy _as long as that's the best way to make more money_. But given the choice of making a lot of money while making customers happy and making more money by screwing them the corporations have no (legal) choice but to screw the customers.As to your definition of altruism, that will have to stand for you. It's not a definition shared by very many. If you continue to use words with a definition you invent yourself, it's going to be difficult to communicate meaningfully with your peers. Not that I believe true altruism actually exist. But self interest can frequently masquerade as altruism quite effectively, and be virtually indistinguishable from it.Your implied idea that capitalism has some monopoly on ""free"" trade is also so patently ridiculous that I can't even be bothered to comment on it.And as to ""free choice"" in the capitalist countries of today, what choice do I have, for example, if I want to watch my movies, or TV shows, or sports events, or news without commercials? None. Other than that Alaskan cave you mention. And even if I take the draconian step of not watching TV at all, because I dislike the commercials so much, I STILL have to pay for those commercials every time I go shopping. Some choice, huh? I can give you more examples like this if you're interested.And returning to trade. You're not , even in the US, allowed to trade in everything you like. You're for example forbidden to trade in heroin, where you actually face that gun you were speaking about if you don't comply (or his brother, the chair). But maybe that's socialism, what do I know?As a concluding remark, I find it interesting that everytime any of the serious organizations (american mostly) compile reports on the happiest countries in the world, the US are beaten by this or that ""socialist"" country. But I guess these organizations must be socialist themselves. An no, I'm not paranoid. I swear! They're REALLY out to get me!!!",1176363116,,comment,,0.083,0.798,0.12,0.9623

For example if you are an amateur investor with a small portfolio you can have windows to yahoo finance and get share prices/graphs of you stock. If you're a YouTube-aholic your fave videos are all laid out on one dashboard. Once saved anyone could then access it with a fixed url.I'm moonlighting on this, lots of techy issues to resolve still but what do you reckon?PS. to mess around with it click to top icon in the tool box to create a window enter url, drag and resize windows to create your dashboard (text boxes buttons at the top are not in use!).Thankswr1472",1176380817,,comment,,0.029,0.817,0.154,0.973

matter77,,,,12275,,6668.0,1525543787,,"I see the big divide between those who do and those who don't differently. Most people choose a life pursuing happiness, a few choose lives of meaning. The person who chooses a life of meaning wants to get rich, but they secretly don't do it for the money. they simply can't not do their dreams. To most, it's foolishness. It's not that the person choosing a life of meaning doesn't want to be happy, or can't be, it's just that their happiness is largely irrelevant. 
I also disagree with the crap about age. PG filters everything through this fine mesh, then claims the result is representative of the whole. I realized sometime around age 40 that to those who see startups as foolishness, there IS NO GOOD AGE. I kept wondering how I could go instantly from being too young to being too old. According to most, there is no good age. It's always a bad idea.
What PG is experiencing is this. Much of the corporate World, and the homes of families in which people grow up, it is heavily permission-based. In the Midwest for example, anyone behind a tech startup is considered out of line because they didn't ask permission, they didn't spend twenty years climbing a permission ladder. If they succeed, they are thought to have broken the rules. Younger people are more rebellious - we don't need no stinking permission - and can succeed if they don't first spend years working for a bunch of mindless droids. 
Yet, it is still far superior to have broken through all this and risen above it all, to have endured the worst and still plow ahead in relentless pursuit of meaningful dreams to build something great.

SwellJoe,,,,12365,,12335.0,1525543801,,"PHP is pragmatic and pretty fast, but everything, everything, everything, beyond the ""HTML template language"" bits, are bolted on with whatever tools were handy at the moment.  I'd be stunned if more than a couple hours of design work went into the object system, the type system (where == and === are used for evil rather than good), or even the standard library function names.It has some strengths: Big library (not as big or as high quality as CPAN, so if library support is what you need, go for Perl), a lot of example code (but it's mostly horrible quality...even good examples are pretty bad in spots), and really easy deployment.  So, if you're building an Open Source project that you want a lot of people to use, it's a great choice--PHP is available on every hosting server on the planet.  Or, if you need a ""blank-plus-this-widget"" you can probably find the ""blank"" already written in PHP and then build your ""widget"" on top.But, if you're starting from scratch, why commit yourself to working with a shoddy language for the months or years it'll take to finish?  There are good imperative languages out there for web app development: Ruby and Python, in particular.  Though the frameworks craze for these languages are partly to bridge the gap that they have with PHP (they're all missing a ""view"" layer for the web, because PHP is a reasonably powerful, if ugly, template system), and a lot of the other crap just makes things ugly...they get built for one particular application and then stretched for general-purpose use, and in the stretching they get a bit misshapen and hard to fit into any specific task.Anyway, Ruby and Python are pretty and reasonably consistent languages that are nice to work with.  PHP is neither.  Perl...well, it ain't necessarily pretty, but CPAN is hard to beat when you just want to get the job done...and you can treat it as a functional language pretty effectively, which is all the rage around these parts (and you'll probably want to after you see the bolted on object system).",1176416024,,comment,,0.091,0.741,0.168,0.9859

What is great about mathematics is that it is a tinkertoy of metaphor, and thus offers unlimited possibilities for new metaphors. Rigor is the window through which intuition shines. erdos2 discovered an enumeration formula for a class of combinatorial objects (the ""almost-injective"" functions) with the following decomposition: the formula is a sum of two terms, the first of which has a closed form representation as fixed sum of generalized hypergeometric functions and which is asymptotically significant; the second is provably not representable in closed form (hence there is no closed form enumeration formula for the almost injective functions), and asymptotically negligible. Moreover, the significant term is asymptotically equivalent to a simpler hypergeometric function, from which a limit probability distribution for the almost injective functions can be derived.""I wonder if these responses are far less memorable than a high quality ass wiping algorithm.

I wanted it real bad but my parents told me they wouldn't buy it for me.  I had to buy it myself.  It was a hundred dollars.  That much money to me seemed insane.My parents both made crafts and went to craft shows to sell their wares.  I asked if I could sell stuff too and they were overjoyed.  I made little fluffy things out of Fun Fur: little snake with googly eyes that rose up when you petted it and tufts glued to the end of pencils to look like those little troll dolls.  Each one was priced at a dollar and my mom subsidized my venture by buying all the materials.  I had to sell a hundred of them to buy my truck.  I was an ADD kid so I couldn't even count that high without getting distracted.Time rolled on and slowly over the course of a dozen or so craft sales my pile of cash grew and grew until I had enough.

There's a very good reason why it's often referred to as ""runway.""The number one motivating factor for startups and the reason why they're able to operate more efficiently than larger competitors boils down to one thing: desperation.  Having limited resources makes you desperate and hungry.  Besides, living in a cramped apartment and eating ramen is a good reminder of what you get when you don't win (and having a roof over your head ain't too bad).Paying yourselves $300K when you guys probably don't have revenue is a great way to mislead your investors, create politics amongst employees, and, most of all, make you complacent.Now, (mis)using investors' money to live the life isn't unheard of.  I once interned at a company that basically lost hundreds of millions of dollars every year and addressed this by systematic studio closures and layoffs.  The company's misfortunes resulted from poor oversight by the management team and had almost nothing to do with those being laid off (they all went on the be headhunted by competing firms).  Following suit, every year, product-producing employees were let go while executives maintained their $400K salaries.  The management team basically did whatever they could to keep the company alive while they drew as much salary as possible.  Interestingly enough, this behavior actually began when they got funded in the late 1980s.

In those moments, I'm not really seeing anything (exception noted above) but my mind is just cranking on something.  After a few of these sessions (the quantity varies on how complex the problem is I'm currently working on) I get the Aha! moment.So I guess the skill is to be able to reduce conscious focus to free up access to your subconscious at opportune times.  In my college days, I used to do this at inopportune moments, such as driving home.  On several occasions, I would drive right by my apartment and basically start getting lost before realizing I had been in ""subconscious"" mode and had no idea where I was going.An excellent way to access your subconscious is hard-core exercise.  I've had the experience when swimming many laps, biking up a mountain, or cross-country skiing where I hit ""the zone"", the moment when your body is taking you with very little mental effort.  That is when the subconscious flys and you can really solve some of the hardest problems.I think sleep-deprivation is also a way to reduce conscious focus.  I've hatched many integrations when running on too little sleep.  There is the ""sleeper's high""  period which is especially good for subconscious work.  Beware, however, of the big low you can get afterward.  Push it too far, and you can get downright depressed.  My record to date is 72 hours of focused work with very few breaks.

If that's the case, then the bottleneck becomes the database, and that's the key issue IMHO (and the hardest one to solve).In Java (more specifically JBoss), clustering is implemented at the application logic level: The app server manages the state of the application and then it caches and replicates the state whenever necessary.I really don't see how Rails will solve this problem unless with some kind of application-level communication across the servers...

Now there is another <i>layer</i> on top to get in the way albeit with less choice.  
Flash has it's place. But in moderation. It's just another form of vendor lock-in for developers and cannot always guarantee anything approaching usable results when it fails. <i>'...

aston,,,,12649,,12647.0,1525543843,,"One of my favorite quotes about startups, which I original attributed to PG (due to [1]) but really belongs to Peter Steiner [2] is ""On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.""The big idea is that so long as you're hiding behind the magic of servers and networking, your business even as a young, fresh-out-of-college startupper looks just as legit as any other business on the web. Maybe even more legit, if you put in the work to look super stodgy.The odd thing is everybody knows all of the YC companies are run by ""dogs,"" and that's where the fun is. In fact, I'd say the human interest story of college kids making millions from only $20k of funding is the biggest selling point for a lot of the YCombinator companies. Not to demean their products, but I can't remember the last time my mom got excited about, say, her Oracle online calendar. On the other hand, Kiko's a really interesting story.All of this leads me to believe that simply being a part of YCombinator alleviates suspicion of all of the bad aspects of being a dog (lack of credibility, obvious inexperience, youthful stupidity) and also exposes all of the good aspects (mostly, the publicity, and perhaps the fact that you're more in touch with what's new and hot). In the end, I think this is a net win for folks like me. To what I think will be a large extent, companies doing something obviously YCombinator-like will catch all of the YC benefits simply by association. I wonder, though, if companies that are branching out into new areas who can't manage YCombinator-style support will still have to struggle with being taken seriously. And I still find it ironic that PG's the main reason something he's said previously is being proved irrelevant.[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html</a>[2] <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html"">http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html</a>",1176487283,,comment,,0.074,0.788,0.139,0.9781

The trick is to not beg for approval, you want to have the investors begging you to take their investment. Or so I think... but seriously, it sounds like you have been rejected three times, that is nothing. Think about dating - would self-pity and begging win you the favours of any girl? If everybody gave up after three rejections, humans would be extinct by now.If you are so creative, why can't you find other ways to raise money? Besides, I think if you apply for YC you don't really need money (because surely you could get 15000$ somehow), it is all about the experience, right? If you build your startup anyway, it will be exciting and interesting, too. Who knows, next year YC might invite you as a speaker.

mattjaynes,,,,12663,[12685],12625.0,1525543845,,"From my notes of PG's talk on Wednesday:12. There are 2 kinds of judgments: Admissions and Grades
If you get a bad grade in a class, but think you did a great job, then you feel entitled to go and talk to the teacher and challenge the decision. On the other hand, that entitlement feeling isn't present if you apply to a college and get denied. This is because in admissions there are a limited number of seats available and a cutoff point at which no more people can be accepted. Like in the olympic tryouts - the top X% of swimmers for a country may get to go to the games, but those below that threshold don't get to go. It's not much different in getting funding - you can just slide off the edge and just not make the 'admission'. When I was rejected by Harvard I thought I sucked. Now I see it as laughable. Have you ever been to the admissions office? A rejection in an admissions scenario is not necessarily a reflection on you. At YCombinator we go through and rank all of the applications, then we take the top 30 for interviews. Recently we looked at some of our early teams and compared how they are doing now with how we rated them in the application process. It was scary! One of our most successful teams was at number 30! Just one more down and they would have missed the cutoff.",1176489905,,comment,,0.114,0.754,0.132,0.2438

If you think about the scope of what's happening, the scope is usually very tight. At most, the conversation goes on for a few days, then essentially fades away as the topic (really, the post the comments are connected with) slides down the list and gets buried. Once the post has been fully buried, the conversation has effectively stopped. The thing that would be really great would be to link prior conversations to new, but related topics. Let's say that next week it turns out that Imus made those comments under duress. Some lunatic pointed a gun at him and forced him to say those things. Instead of rehashing all that stuff again, it'd be great to dredge that conversation up as a starting point. I know I'm not making this very clear. But I tried.

Here's a little about what I'm doing.I've worked in the video game industry for the last two years, and I've been messing around with Direct3D/OpenGL for about 5.  I believe wrapping these API's in an extremely high level language like Lisp might speed up creation of a video game by about an order of magnitude, especially if I expose only very high level graphical concepts to Lisp, instead of just exposing every API function.Speed is crucial.  I've layered Ruby onto my engine, but the problem was that if I wanted 60 frames per second, I could only do 16,000 Ruby if-statements per frame.  That wouldn't work at all.Even if the high level language I choose is only 4-10 times slower than C++, that would be fine.  Ruby was about 100-200 times slower.Investigating Lisp, I only require two things:1) Somehow, I expose C functions to Lisp.  These functions take standard types as arguments (float, int, double, char ...).For example, I might expose, from C:(Edit: argh, I can't write a star on News.YC.  The following should read: ""const char (star)str"")void print_to_game_console(const char str);Then in lisp, I'd then be able to do
(print_to_game_console ""Odelay!"")Something along those lines.2) Lisp only has access to what I expose.  I won't get into the boring details, but I'm distributing the Lisp script files for anyone to edit and run on other's machines, so sandboxing Lisp somehow is also pretty crucial.  As long as under no circumstances can Lisp access the file system, then everything else is fine.Thanks everyone!

Assuming your course of study is actually difficult and rigorous, your degree is a real accomplishment, and to be lauded; yet it does not directly yield positive financial results.It seems easier to go back to school later and follow a prescribed course of study on a regular schedule than to found a start-up at a later age, with all its unpredictability and long hours.Electing not to obtain a degree is to accept a set of obstacles and challenges in dealing with others who place a premium on third-party certifications.

Some of this stems from the way the game business generally operates (milestone system) where developers often don't see royalties until their publishers cover their own costs.  Not to mention that the MMO category is severely crowded and extremely high risk...web startups can put out a beta in 1-2 months and user test the heck out of it whereas MMO developers basically don't get any resolution until they sink $10-30 million upfront into a project.  Additionally, unless Red5 develops some killer intellectual property, studio acquisitions usually happen at the 30-50 person headcount for $5-15 million.

Looking back at how discussion systems evolved over the years, it's easy to see that small steps have been taken to improve the user experience be enforcing an overall higher quality of content.Since users shape the community, you have two choices in dealing with an evolving site: keep your initial vision by implementing rules and potentially alienating certain user groups; or letting your site adapt to the users. Both are valid approaches. Slashdot takes the former, because it has moderators, and digg takes the latter, so it's userbase keeps growing while the quality keeps dropping. I imagine reddit would take the latter path too. news.yc is also facing the same kind of change. Recalling the bunch of ""delete me"" posts last week, it seems like quality control is done mostly by self-policing of some sort.It's an issue of how much control and what tastes the users have, and what mechanisms have been implemented to strengthen or weaken the expression these tastes in the system.

shiro,,,,12826,,12686.0,1525543869,,"You're half right.  Tuned Lisp code can be as fast as C, but you have to know the compiler so intimately that you can tell what kind of machine insturctions it is generating; you'll use ""disassemble"" a lot (""disassemble"" is a part of CommonLisp standard---you may get a sense how Lispers are performance freak).  Usually the bottleneck part is tuned to the point that it won't do any allocation and run-time type dispatch at all.There's one big advantage of using Lisp over C for performance: Macros.  During optimization it is typical that you have to write several versions of code, changing bits and pieces, and run benchmarks to see what is optimal.  Macros allow you to generate different versions of code from simple changes of parameters, without incurring overhead of function call/variable reference etc.  (You can do similar thing in C++ templates, but Lisp macros allows much more).  If you can easily parameterize your code, you can try more ideas and run more benchmarks, so it is more likely that you'll find better optimization.AN example: Allegro CL version 7 and later has Perl-compatible regular expression library, purely written in Lisp, that runs faster than Perl (at least at the moment I wrote it, using benchmark suite came with PCRE).

Casual gamers expect more these days.  Adventure games are also much harder and take much more time to clone.  Finally, you could sell level packs to your customers once your actual product is done, something that you can't do for games with random levels.  I think between your web site and the main portals (RealArcade, BigFishGames, Oberon) and your own web site you can start your own niche.  Just make sure you can partner with somebody who can create great art, quickly.  However, the kind of companies PG wants for YC are ones that can have a reasonable demo after just three months of work, and also those that he knows enough about that he can actually contribute to.  In other words, there are millions of things in the digital world one could make money off, but PG (like everybody else) is interested in a subset of them, and no investor who wants to be involved with a project will choose one where you'll be in the corner working on your own thing and he will only play a small role in the fun.  (I wouldn't be surprised if helping startups from scratch IS like an adventure game to PG.)And, actually, Yahoo! could actually buy you considering they are one of the top places for selling casual games.  BigFishGames bought a developer in Europe after he came out with 2 or 3 hit games within 1 year, and called it BigFishGames Europe.  In other words, the portals are buying developers who can actually create a quality game on a low budget, quickly and repeatedly.  When they own the developer, they can put it on the front page and make a lot more profit, such as BigFishGames is doing with their Mystery series of games.  But, some people have made a decent living (not millionaires, but livable).If you want to create adventure games that use the mouse that are easy to get into and want to make about $8-$10 per sale on the portals and about $18 on your web site, go for it.  Those are the kinds of games that people want which are also hard to clone, and hard to find a free flash game online to replace.  You also have the advantage of creating some IP (character, names, trademarks) to use later, which is hard to do if you're just creating Bejeweled (and for which games will easily find flash games if they don't want to pay for the real versions.)So, go for it, as long as you are focusing on creating an actual game as soon as possible, and not spending the next 10 months developing a framework for your future game, because that is pointless.  Aveyond is not an adventure game but more like an RPG, but it was a good seller (supposedly) and made in Game Maker (which also supports old-school one-screen-at-a-time adventure games.)  Just create some kind of an adventure game where you own the IP using Game Maker, then after you are a big success you can port it to XBOX 360 or the Mac.

randallsquared,,,,12895,"[13074, 13031]",12795.0,1525543879,,"For someone with an actual degree, it ranges from ~20K starting on up to 60K or so in this area.  There aren't many of those 60K jobs, though.  People who have ambitions beyond ~40K typically either move or start their own business(es).  More than half the people I know run a one-person business either on the side or instead of having a ""job"".There are a coupla barriers to moving; we have a house to pay for, hardly know anyone (personally) who doesn't live around here, and have issues ""getting a decent salary"" due to history.   I've been freelancing for seven years, with no degree, and it turns out that people aren't interested in hiring someone like that remotely.  In 2003, we gave moving to the Boston area a shot (Nashua), but the only position I managed to get was Comcast tech support (and all our clients were down here, of course), which didn't pay enough to save up enough money for a deposit.  It was a totally different world up there.  Here, if you have a thousand dollars, you can pay a deposit and the first two months rent, and have plenty left over to look for a job for a month.  Your first full paycheck at even a convenience store would pay the rent.  In Nashua, I was making (for the 6 months we were there) about the same amount I would here for the same job, except that landlords wanted outrageous sums for housing that even slumlords would be ashamed of in the South.  ""Let me get this straight: you want nearly a thousand a month for a room that doesn't even have a private bath?!  Did you accidentally include an extra zero?""Anyway, enough ranting. :)  If you've lived in such a place long enough to think it's normal to pay thousands a month, rather than hundreds, just to have food, gas, and a small house, I imagine it's hard to understand the shock.  Six months into that attempted move, after being too exhausted from dealing with people all day (I'm not a people person) to do anything but collapse into bed, it finally became clear that there was essentially no way we would ever be able to save up enough money (we had to stay in weekly places, due to never having the 2K or so it would have required to get a crappy apartment).  We'd been spoiled by doing exactly this same thing in 1998 moving to Florida, and having that turn out well.  So, basically, the biggest barrier is that it would take years of saving, here, to come up with enough money to not instantly be homeless in the Boston area or SV.  Alternatively, we can just continue with doing startups in extremelycheapland, while living a middle class lifestyle on 15 hours of freelancing a week.

gibsonf1,,,,12958,,12942.0,1525543888,,"Interesting point.  I agree that the biggest procrastination inducing disincentive to <i>starting</i> creative work is the preconception in the creator's mind that ""this will be a great thing - I will make it perfect"", etc.  I learned while designing in architectural school that the key to good design was to strip away all preconceptions about a problem before starting - which is dramatically harder than it sounds.  The preconception of a quest for perfection before starting is the most important one.However, once you have ""programmed"" your conscious mind with the problem, allowed your subconscious to crunch on it and give you the first draft of a solution to the problem, the quest for making it as good as possible is key to actually having it be good.  With that first solution, you can then refine it, with the idea of making it increasingly better. The question then is when do you stop (or go live) - a very important point.   The beauty of web development is that you can think of the project as an evolution toward being very good from somewhat humble beginnings.  This makes it that much easier to come to the good-enough point faster than in the past stand-alone application days, but then continue improving as long as the project continues to be exciting.  The ""lets make it better"" drive is a really important motivator, at least it is for me.

nostrademons,,,,13000,,12989.0,1525543894,,"Learn to program.  ;-)Seriously, there are a bunch of reasons why coders turn down a startup:1.) Not enough compensation.  If you're paying them cash, you have to pay them market rates.  For a bright but junior programmer, that's minimum $55-60K/year. salary in most of the tech hotspots.  For someone experienced, figure at least $100k/year.  If you're looking for hourly contractors, expect to pay at least $75/hour for anyone decent.  If you give them equity - well, I personally would not join a startup for less than 20% equity, and I suspect many other technical founders have similar minimums.  Actually, the only reason my current startup got away with so little (I'm getting 25%) is because it has 5 founders, and nobody else has more than 25%.2.) Boring idea.  Good programmers like to work on interesting problems.  I joined my startup because it was in a problem domain that I waste a lot of time in anyways, I knew the area, and it'd let me try some cool stuff that I didn't know if I could do, but it'd be fun as hell to try.3.) They don't trust you.  Techies have a natural aversion to business-type people.  Be straight with them, always.  The second they think you're trying to bullshit them, they'll walk away.4.) They don't think you add much value.  Ultimately, it'll be the techie building the product.  They need a reason why working with you beats building the product on your own.  Usually, your best bet is to have a large personal network, or good people skills, or the ability to sell something.  I don't think it's necessarily true that techies can't be good with people, but in my experience, I can't code <i>and</i> be good with people at the same time, so have a cofounder with people skills has been a big win for me.Remember, if you're founding a technical startup, you want the best coder you can find.  He'll usually be young, because good experienced coders typically have families and will not work for stock, and you generally can't afford the $150K/year that they'll cost you.  <i>Don't</i> try to skimp and get cheaper labor - lots of companies tried that in the dot-com bomb (notably Value America), and they almost universally went out of business.  Average coders cannot hit the high notes; you need to hit the high notes as a startup, because all of the middle ground is taken.In my case, I met my cofounder at Homecoming.  We'd lived across the hall from me sophomore year, so I went over to talk to him and see what he was doing.  Turned out he was working on a startup in a field I was interested in.  He introduced me to the other cofounders afterwards (2 of which I already knew from college).  I didn't actually join until several months later, when their initial choice for a technical founder quit, but he kept my name in mind.  ",1176598918,,comment,,0.087,0.769,0.143,0.9856
BitGeek,,,,13001,[13050],12808.0,1525543894,,"If you're running a web based business (eg: not a retailer, but where everything is an online service) then the domicile of the business is the web, not any nationality.  In other words, you can incorporate anywhere you wish and its legitimate- the act of incorporation creates the domicile for the business. If you're going to do business in Japan to the point that you have above ground employees (taxes, social security, etc.) then you'll have to find out the Japanese laws. Even then it probably makes sense to incorporate outside of Japan for tax reasons.   A foriegn corporation operating in a country is generaly treated differently (and better) than a domestic corporation.But, if not, then you can incorporate in any jurisdiction which is friendly to corporations.I would strongly recommend you do not incorporate in the US.  The USA is not a friendly jurisdiction for corporations and all the trends are that it is getting worse.  Ths US has enacted currency controls, limiting ones ability to move money in and out of the country-- this is the first step in the creation of an ""iron curtain"".  (Requiring passports of people who travel, as the US started doing in January is the second step.) It is only appropriate to incorporate in america if your business is completely located in america.  (If you want to find out what your government does all day, just file business papers in many states- over the next 6 weeks you'll get contacted by many dozens of different agencies, all of whom want you to do paperwork and give them money. Texas is an exeption to this, Nevada may be as well.) Ok, on to the real advice-- look at countries that are pro-business, or who are, or used to be tax havens.  The caymen islands and bahamas are obvious choices, but also st kitts and nevis are worth checking out.  You can legally incorporate there.  Some of these islands have restrictions about the business you can operate there, but are happy to incorporate foriegn businesses (that is to say, its easier if you'll not be opening an office on their soil).Along those lines- ex UK protectorates, consider the Isle of Man (or is it the Isle of Wight?) and closer to home, New Zealand and Australia.  These latter two are high tax states, but are closer and may prove to be good choices for you. Also consider the united arab emerites, monaco and Mauritius.  These are a different style, but they may prove to be good places.Finally, probably the best place to incorporate is Panama.  Their government is oriented around providing services to foriegn industry... starting with the canal, but also ships registry, bank registration, incorporation and trust services, etc.  This is probably one of the easiest places to do it.If you're planning to bank outside of Japan, you might consider incorporating in Switzerland, so that your corporation and your bank can have closer ties.  But I haven't looked into that much. Its hard to find good information on this subject, probably because US courts have thrown people in jail for giving ""Advice on how to avoid US taxes""... so, while this isn't a tax dodge (you're not a US citizen) people are wary of talking about it.",1176598923,,comment,,0.014,0.85,0.135,0.9971

Hopefully once you're at that point you're better equipped to spot broken stuff that you don't necessarily use (or even want to use).

Re-reading the original parent article I missed the collaborative blogging bit.So I took some time and tried some more stuff and it works fine.

So what I found, was pretty factual for a single user working on a document. <i>'...

DanB,,,,13121,,9770.0,1525543912,,"This is developing news, and there are a few interesting consequences:1. Microsoft's software is unmaintainable, without throwing titanic amounts of money at it. This means that if Microsoft experiences declining sales on its basic products (Windows, Office), the products themselves will disappear. In a decade, Wine may be all that is left of Windows.2. The price of Windows is increasing, as the price of computers is plummeting. A $2000 computer with a $100 operating system works. A $500 computer with a $200 operating system doesn't. Windows should cost no more than $20 today. Microsoft's model is clearly unsustainable.3. The biggest benefit from Microsoft alternatives isn't replacing Windows, the benefit is being able to do things that were never possible with Windows. Linux bootable CD/flash is a wonderful approach for single-purpose devices, which is what most of the world wants almost all computers to be.I've been programming computers for 40 years now, and this is about the third major transition I've been through. It is by far the most fun.

Using combinations of NLP, integration with desktop tools and novel user interaction taking cues from Adventure games. [5]Reference[0]  I was going to title it <i>'what's the hard problem you're currently working on?'</i> but this title from pg's article 'good & bad procrastination' is better.[1] pg, 'Good and bad procrastination'<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html</a>[2] arasakik, 'How do you come up with your ideas for startups?'<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=12995"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=12995</a>[3] amichail, 'What is your idea filter?

you can get the machine to do the hardwork & spit out the necessary information  just in time as it's needed.

gibsonf1,,,,13288,[13293],13231.0,1525543937,,"(The office was finished early this year)Here are some of the ideas I was working with specifically for making developer work spaces (This space is for a very fast growing but financially mature business - not a cash-strapped startup.  My primary advice for a startup office space: buy DOORS for desks!.  You can get doors at home depot for desks - hollow core nice wood without the door handles drilled out for just over $10 apiece.  Put the doors on top of file cabinets, and voila, you have a nice looking desk at very low cost that can last for years if you like.):From the hackers perspective:+Each space had to have natural light and views, but be closable for privacy.  The point here is to allow for staring into the distance when the subconscious is cranking on an idea, allow the space to be closed during moments of extreme focus, and to have the doors be a sign to others which mode the person is in at the time.+Each space had to allow for a small conference of 2-3 people for easy and impromptu discussions.+Each space had to have a lot of attention to detail and materials to make the spaces feel personal.+There had to be a space for larger meeting outside of the formal business conference room.  I turned the lunch-room into one of the key design spaces and put whiteboards all along one wall with data ports for easy discussions and to make having lunch more fun.  (The company provides free lunch every day)+The developer area had to be acoustically protected from the back office area, the customer relations area and the accounting area to avoid concentration disruptions.+The space was in a classic old building with exposed wood beams and ceilings, so we used a raised floor system (with no sign to the user that it's raised) to have all the heating/cooling provided from the floor and allow for easy addition and movement of data and power ports.+The server room was treated as a ""jewel"" with wall to wall glass for people (especially hackers) to appreciate the racks of technology at their fingertips.  (Also, the servers had multiple power back up systems including generators, a fire suppression system that would not damage the equipment in case it was used, and its own cooling system to run at ideal temperatures with a lot of extra rack space to allow for easy growth.)From Management's Perspective:+The space had to be flexible to allow for reconfiguration and potentially moving out to another space in the future.",1176731743,,comment,,0.028,0.811,0.16,0.9961

While achieving a critical mass might be impossible (read unlikely and hard to control) if you try for the world as a whole, it may be possible for a smaller one.  Once you have a small group that is largely converted you can add other groups in such a way that you don't put out the fire by separating members of the first group.  It may be that a large part of the success of Facebook comes from the way they were able to use student bodies as small, self-contained networks, and then build from there.It reminds me of building a fire with charcoals.  If you keep them together you can keep them burning.  If you can get a nice group going you can add to it bit by bit and build as big as you want.  If you disperse them they die.Our world has a million little self-contained networks.  If you try to win some over perhaps some will succeed to the point that the network works for you.  Then maybe you can add others.

But IMHO, that's missing the point of the article.Music doesn't <i>objectively</i> get better just because more people listen to it; and yet, the authors' research appears to show that people's opinions of music is hugely influenced by what other people like. Recall their main result: They had one group of users who they didn't show any information about how often a song was downloaded, and then eight independent groups who were shown the download count of each song inside that group. ""The song 'Lockdown,' by 52metro, for example, ranked 26th out of 48 in [the group not shown download counts]; yet it was the No. 1 song in one social-influence world, and 40th in another. Overall, a song in the Top 5 in [the group not shown counts] had only a 50 percent chance of finishing in the Top 5 of success."" Their conclusion is that the reason why predicting the success of media products is shaky is that what's a success is hugely influenced by an unpredictable feedback process.Thus, my question: Can we assume that Google's success is due in a large part not to anything that Google did, but to the (random) feedback process of people liking Google because they see other people liking Google?Of course, one could argue that this is simply the truism that one needs luck as well as talent to succeed.

Eric Schmidt comments on this all the time, it's a significant risk factor for Google.Brand loyalty is a cumulative advantage, but it's pretty fickle.  Customers will stick with a trusted brand as long as they continue to trust it, but all it takes is one or two screwups or a competitor coming out with a noticeably better product, and your brand evaporates.I first used Google in 1999, and it was <i>much</i> better than the existing search engines.  Not a little better, not even just noticeably better, but orders of magnitude better.  I could immediately find results that I'd previously have to dig through 10 pages of links for.They may not have that advantage now, but I don't care.  Google is good enough.  Until someone comes out with a search engine that's <i>noticeably</i> better, I'm not going to switch.  I've already got my Firefox toolbar setup, and my habits - I see no reason to reevaluate them until there's clear evidence that I can do better.Google almost pulled off the same thing with GMail, but Yahoo and Microsoft stopped them.  When GMail came out, it was orders of magnitude better than the existing webmail solutions.  It gave you 1GB of space instead of 4MB, it had Google search integrated, and it had a clean AJAX UI.  Like many early adopters, I switched as soon as I could get my hands on an invite (you only got 1 or 2 back then), and have since made GMail my default e-mail client.  But it didn't completely penetrate the mass market, because Y!Mail and Hotmail immediately upped their storage space to 400+ MB, and Yahoo came out with a new UI.  IMHO, GMail is still better, but it's no longer an <i>order of magnitude</i> better, so people who are just getting GMail invites now often choose to stick with their existing e-mail.",1176753604,,comment,,0.043,0.754,0.204,0.9958

You want to put yourself in positions where you have the leverage.""  For example, if you apply to a college, and thousands of applicants are just like you, then you don't have leverage.Your examples just ignore the fact that people get rejected from about 4 colleges a year, while they have a chance to correct their tests and homeworks about 1,000 times a semester.This means that the numbers simply don't match up.  If you appealed 1,000 college decisions, you would have a great chance to get into a lot of them.  If you appealed 1,000 questions on a homework to one busy and egotistical professor, they would likely start avoiding you after the 10th question.Therefore, people SHOULD appeal everything they want to, whether the judgement is specifically about them or not.I saw that this was written originally as a post to a question about YC decisions.

""Rather, there are a few who clearly should, a <i>few</i> who clearly shouldn't, and many in-between.  Moreover, this assumes there is a quantity called ""ability"" and that the evaluator is accurately measuring it.  I note the later downplaying of accuracy, but before that, it says:>""Probably the difference between them will be less than the measurement error.""How do you arrive at an estimate of ""measurement error"" in order to claim that?  Did you first measure the evaluator's ""measurement ability""?  With what?Even if we naively assume that we can order a group by ""ability"" with regard to start-ups, and that the difference between adjacent slots is small, it <i>does not follow</i> that your evaluation comes anywhere close to the presumed omniscient set-ordering.The data you have is your self-selected subset, and even there you find that choice #30 is actually in the top few, which is a rather large measurement error; you might argue this doesn't matter in aggregate, but it still argues against any notion of small measurement error.  If you can be off by almost your entire selection size then who knows what you missed in the numbers up to twice the chosen cut-off?  The statement ""it matters least to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has the most effect"" seems self-contradictory.  What I would <i>guess</i> you mean is that if someone is clearly good, they make the cut, and you don't need to scrutinize to find out <i>how</i> good; but it still matters that you put them on the right side of the cut!It matters <i>the most</i> to judge accurately where judgement has the most effect -- given the nature of start-ups, your <i>missed</i> borderline case could be the one that would have been larger than all the rest put together.  Remember <i>your</i> perceived borderline is not the same as <i>the</i> actual borderline.  See Bessemer's anti-portfolio: <a href=""http://www.bvp.com/port/anti.asp"">http://www.bvp.com/port/anti.asp</a>
  The article seems to focus on accuracy initially, then semi-mea-culpa its way out of it later.Reading hundreds of applications, your eyes glaze over, and you may only notice someone when they happen to push one of your buttons by chance.It's fine to say you think you selected an ""optimal subset"" of people according to your checklist, biases, or opinions; but don't confuse that with ""ability"".  You have an idea of what you want and pick according to resemblance to it: small teams that remind you of Viaweb's structure.Using the game theory definitions, I don't find it discouraging that you chose an ""optimal"" set, which is clearly different in this case from ""maximal"" ;)Just don't confuse maximal individual ability with optimal set selection, which is what you appear to do with your example of selecting players for a national team.Tanenbaum would've failed Torvalds due to his own <i>bias</i>, which is clearly separate from Linus's ability.

If you doubt that, ask anybody in the profession where being judged is in its nature (I sometimes audition as an actor so I think I know that business a bit.)Your mentioning about hidden bias is somewhat true, except that it's not really hidden, but just implicit---in most of the judgement there are always some implicit criteria the choosers have, and good players know that.  Assuming otherwise is too naive.About appealing: As far as you're not in the few of the obvious top group or in the obvious fall-behind groups in terms of the primary factors, any arbitrary secondary factors can put you in either side.  Those factors are so random and it's waste of time to appeal---sure, you may have some chance of the judgements reversed, but it is much wiser to spend that time to make yourself excel in the primary factors, so that next time such randomness will affect less to the outcome, because if you like to live a life taking challenges, you will be constantly judged, and you won't have time to deal with those randomness.

rms,,,,13464,,13193.0,1525543964,,"To cure HIV: Start with some adult stem cells from the HIV patient to be treated, specifically the stem cells that produce T cells. We introduce the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene and grow the cells in culture. These can then be ""transplanted"" back into the patient. These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS. There will be no chance of rejection since they are the patient's own cells. Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease. It could also be used as a preventative therapy, which we can also easily test on the mice.",1176768448,,comment,,0.079,0.858,0.063,-0.8478

For example, we are a music site so first  thing we want to serve is GREAT MUSIC -- NOT social networking features. Now that we have a stable base of users and increasing, we can add more features. If we added those general social networking features at the beginning, it would dilute the main function of the site and be classified as yet another social network.I suggest you have a launch date. For us it helped us feel internally hyped. It also means you will hold yourself to some quality standard if you do planned releases rather than code as you go. Do few things, do it REALLY well.

ecuzzillo,,,,13578,[13584],13577.0,1525543980,,"iTunes is more about dealmaking and vendor lock-in than it is about technology or tools. I mean, it's just a file-downloading and hard-disk-access tool, plus a DRM system, plus a nice UI. People were downloading files and accessing hard disks and writing UI's in 1970; maybe they didn't have DRM, but that's hardly an advance. No, the reason iTunes is popular is because a) the iPod is popular, and the iPod only works (well) with iTunes; and b) Apple has made big deals with big record companies to put tons of songs on iTunes. iTunes is not a technological step up; it's just a parlaying of Apple's muscle and hardware marketshare. So, even before iTunes existed, you'd probably have difficulty starting a startup which was supposed to do what iTunes does now, since without the iPod and Apple's negotiating power, you're left with a file downloading utility with DRM and no songs from major records, and nobody wants that. So iTunes not only isn't a tool, it isn't a startup-applicable idea; nobody would shy away from doing iTunes because it's a non-social-network application, because they wouldn't try to do iTunes to begin with. Edit: Anyway, I think it's reasonable to think that a lot of the obvious straight-web-tools genres are well-done enough already that you'd have difficulty starting a startup in one. There might be whole new markets for straight tools out there for the taking, but they're at the very least harder to think of than they were in 1995. A lot of the equivalently easy-to-think-of social applications are just now getting off the ground, so the whole essay kind of makes sense. The most interesting thing about the article to me is that it seems to imply a theory of waves of market gaps closing, and that maybe each market gap gets created by the closing of the one before it. There was a market gap for PCs, then that got (more or less) filled, which created a market gap for connectivity, the filling of which created a market gap for web tools, and now that closing has created a market gap for social tools. It could be totally bunk, but it's fun to think about anyway. ",1176795558,,comment,,0.04,0.883,0.077,0.9335

Array ""c"" maintains a count of the number of times a user id is seen.  Array ""s"" accumulates the scores for each user id.

Indeed, in many ways the transitions saw a decrease in certain kinds of complexity.  Harmonic rhythm, that is the speed at which the underlying chord pattern changes, slowed down during the late 18th century.  Tuning shifted from meantone to equal temperament.  (More complex to implement, but results in a cleaner+simpler UI for musicians ;)Also, there were advances in instrument design.  In particular, the piano of the 19th century was much like a modern piano.  Compared to the 18th century piano, it had a much more expressive power.  Bach for example really could not write crescendos into his keyboard music.  The keyboards of the time didn't do dynamics very well.  He had organs and harpsichords and clavicords and such.

But there are small things that pisses me off.""I've like 7 years of experience with real development. From perl procedural coding without any framework to Objective C (to show the more bizarre language I've worked). I developed (not alone) a simple and small perl framework that is being used on iJigg and due to my experience what I can say is:You have to choose the language and framework that will suit  your application needs.If your application will change everyday don't go for java or C, use these easy to change/handle languages like perl, python, php.If your application deals a lot with IO and disk usage go for C, C++, Objective C.If you have many programmers you need something like Java, that IMHO is good because people will code only what you let them code. A good programmer will make the same code as a beginner one. I always thought that Java was made for mass production.About frameworks, you don't need them if you have something as simple as www.thankyou2006.com.Frameworks are great, I couldn't live without them when building complex applications but there are many traps when using them. The learning curve and the freedom to hack it.This comment is already too big, I've to write something more elaborated.

There's no script or formula to do this, but that's one question I've found to be useful.For example, User A says: put a link on my profile, which when clicked shows my age, sex and location. You should ask, ""why do you need that?""The User will often respond in some way which will give you a clue as to what they're really looking for. So, the response to that question might be, ""oh, well, people always email me to ask me what my a/s/l is and I'm tired of telling them.""So, using this (very lame!) example, they're not looking for a link - they're looking for a way to show their a/s/l on their profile.

Every business has its problems, and most of them are non-trivial (otherwise, everyone would be in the business), so while it's maybe your job to convince someone that your problems are worth solving, it's not necessary to prove that your problems are hard.I also think most hackers get less joy out of pushing technology to the limits and more joy out of doing something well. Sometimes those may coincide (scaling Rails, for example) but often times pushing technology to the limits means you're not solving the problem elegantly/economically.

In a startup past the very earliest ""get-to-prototype"" stages there's a roughly even split between the sucky non-tech stuff and the actual development...you could take the non-tech stuff and leave the hacking to your co-founder.  I'm quite technical and have developed a lot of software in the past ten years, but I found an even better developer and took on the sucky stuff while leaving him to handle most of the development.  It's working very well (though I often find myself wanting to get back to real ""work"" when I'm doing the boring accounting/marketing/taxes/funding/support/etc. stuff--I have to remind myself that if we reach our goals I'll be able to hack anytime I want, in between rides on my robotic dinosaur, of course).",1176849247,,comment,,0.141,0.756,0.103,-0.9199

In fact, I'd hazard a guess that more tech startups will have income than will have external corporate funders.  (This usually happens when the founders need some money, so they put their original idea on hold and do some consulting for a while.  Eventually they're doing exclusively consulting, because it pays well, or at least it pays off quickly.)

The frequent interruptions at the start are irritating. What starts out seeming like a talk turns into a debate between two people, and the change in format is jarring for a bit. And it is hard to understand what Weinberger is getting at. This might have to do with our disparate vocabularies, and the wide disparity in the worlds he and I live in.In spite of these, W does have a point. It is non-trivial to separate the fashionable from the timeless in a thing of beauty. 'Space aliens' may require a human-like visual cortex to appreciate the Mona Lisa. Does that make it just a narrow fad as well, or is a visual cortex a protocol prerequisite to evaluating it? As I asked PG over email, where does fashion end and convention begin?A lot of the ancient philosophical arguments are between polar opposites like these. Should we find out about the world with reason or the senses? Is mind or matter supreme? Is it ok to abort foetuses or not? We know that one can exaggerate anything to make a point, and yet it is easy to fall into the trap of ending up with an extreme viewpoint because one can't decide where to draw the line. Eventually we (will) figure out for each of these issues that there can be richer answers than the obvious black-or-white.So beauty can be timeless, but also tightly bound to a context. It is not clear that all of the latter is bad. How to separate the two? Open question. Relativism is no worse than believing passionately in the wrong anwer.---So much for the academic debate; PG's outlook is more utilitarian[1]. The problem of building beautiful things is a hard one, and it makes more sense for a builder to 'flow timeless' rather than to follow fashions. The alternative may work too, but there's less percentage in it. This is perfectly reasonable, it's just not the same question W is grappling with. Both of them are right, they're just asking slightly different questions. They don't ever figure this out in the video, IMO.BTW, I believe this conversation contributed to a PG essay:

A few years later I worked on another Perl project and spent two days chasing a bug that I could never even have made with Java (due to default initialization of variables, weird scopes and stuff like that).I think Java still has a lot of things going for it, and my most favorite aspect is the documentation. I never spent a  dime on Java books because there is so much excellent documentation available online (starting with the Java Tutorial for beginners). Compare that to Ruby, where you can't even get a specification of the current state of the language for free. Also it seems most of the new developments in IT are being developed for Java first these days, like Aspect Oriented Programming, Dependency Injection and whatever (granted, maybe some of these things would be superfluous in other languages to begin with, I don't know). You get a really good IDE for free (Eclipse), and new add-ons and frameworks for Java are almost forced to also provide plugins for the IDE to work with. For LISP you are still supposed to use Emacs. What do you use for Ruby on Rails?That said, it seems to me the problem with Java is not the language but the people using it. There is a lot of overengineering going on, that just isn't fun anymore. Many people (especially the bosses in the large corporations) have become dogmatic about certain ways to design applications, that are often inappropriate (in my opinion).

Yet in many big cooperations someone up in the management chain has decided that every Java Application has to use EJBs. That I hate, too.

I'll go through my blurred social/professional networks to see who would be into it.  Then again, I'm just looking for someone I already know and like who would dig the project and maybe want to make something of it.  An actual job job, the kind that pays money, can probably afford to be more formal about this sort of thing.  But would you want to be?

So in the general sense,  the logic works.After reading some threads in your news-YC section, I did find that some of the companies not making the grade were ticked off. But, this can be handled by setting expectations and delivering the rejection in the proper manner. We all know that we desire what we cant have.
Put it this way. I am sure that a recruiter that had access to the list of contacts amassed through your funding contests could show a fine ROI on your investment.  No doubt there is value in that network of contacts.BTW the article is Titled:  Paul Graham is Selling our children

Meanwhile, those who are less clued in are going to choose the language they're comfortable with, namely Java.I feel even more confident in that explanation given that he lists C#/.NET as a good language. Syntax-wise, Java and C# are extremely similar, and performance-wise C# might have an edge, but not to the point where it would affect the goodness of apps. The complexity of their respective stacks is pretty similar as well.Moral of the story is, good hackers can make good software in any language you throw at them, and bad coders will not.

Startups base their decisions on your demonstrable talent; everyone else looks at credentials.  If the startup fails (80% chance, on average), not having the credential will be a liability.I wouldn't take an employee position at a company (startup or no) in the bay area for under $100,000, and it would have to be pretty sweet to get me to accept that.

mattjaynes,,,,14246,,14219.0,1525544082,,"My guess is that they'll do just fine. Google's entry into the space gives online presentation tools much more credibility and that can only help Zenter. It's true that many users that would have used Zenter will now use Google Presentations, but now the pool of people using any online presentations tool will be much greater. So it's not a zero-sum game by any means.Also, Google has announced that it will be released ""soon"" which will give Zenter plenty of motivation to beat them to the punch and launch their product.PR, if handled right, can also help Zenter. If they are positioned in the media as the underdog with a real chance of taking on the Giant. Hopefully this will play out differently than Kiko. It all depends on how good Zenter is comparatively. Kiko didn't have much of a chance compared to Google Calendar.I'm curious to see if Zenter will wait to release until after Google Presentations, or if they will release before. There will be the temptation to launch after GPres in order to one-up-them in features before they launch. But if they do that they will lose much of the great PR that they could get if they launched theirs first and started developing a strong initial user community.Ask yourself, would you be more likely to blog about Zenter if they launched before GPres, or after. For me it would definitely be before. Hopefully they will consider the lesson that Odeo learned from launching right after iTunes did. Odeo has it's own problems, but it certainly destroyed their PR strategy when they missed their launch window. ",1176926199,,comment,,0.045,0.772,0.183,0.9906

I don't blame them for hating presentation software, as I hate it, too...but if you're building it, you kind of have to empathize with your users and their needs and desires.I suspect Google is trying to do the same thing they did with GMail, which was to rethink what people wanted in email and then get to the root of why they wanted it rather than slavishly giving users what they asked for (for example, folders and filters and crap being replaced by search that's fast and works) and the traditional view being replaced by a threaded view...in both cases, it simplified the interface by removing the elements that were there for the convenience of the developer rather than the user.  In the case of presentations, sure PowerPoint is bloated and stupid, but people still want their presentations to look good.Now, of course, it's possible that Zenter will get side-tracked by some of the incredibly clever bits (and there are some scarily clever bits in there) and forget to launch before five other worthy competitors enter the field.

For a web app, site, or service - of course you're going to want frequency. When it comes to advertising, the prevailing choice isn't as distinct. I'd contend that reach would have a greater chance of finding potential customers.

mattjaynes,,,,14429,,14403.0,1525544108,,"Unless you have money to burn, I would definitely recommend against hosting at a colo. At the last startup I worked at we had no end of fiascoes regarding our colos. The startup bought over a <i>million</i> dollars of servers and then was paying high-priced employees and consultants to set them up at a colo. But then once the servers were all set up, the colo discovered that they didn't have enough power for our servers. Then we had trouble getting out of the big colo contract that we had signed and had to move all the servers and get them set up at yet another colo. Turns out the next colo also didn't have enough power for our setup even after many reassurances at the beginning that they did. So all in all, this waste of resources put us months behind schedule. Then, ironically we got acquired and no longer even needed our setup because we could then just use the bigger company's server setup.This is another case of 'premature optimization is the root of all evil'. Seriously, we could have done the whole startup with a couple of Dreamhost accounts and launched earlier with a better product and with WAY (millions) more money in the bank. They were optimizing our server setup for HUGE traffic when they should have just been focused on the product.I'm glad I was able to see those mistakes close up. It gave me confidence to do my own startup self-funded since I knew how low I could keep my burn-rate. So now, I'm using EC2 for my servers and it's an amazing experience. I set up a custom server image and then can run multiple instances of it for only 10 cents per server per hour. I can kill instances that I'm not using and bring up a new server within 2 minutes. My server bill is less than $50 a month during development and will be about $100 a month once I launch. I'll also have the ability to scale up VERY quickly and cheaply if I need to.Anyway, that's my take on it from my limited experience. I'm sure there are some guys that are obsessed with doing their own custom server setup at a colo. Good for them. But you have to realize that you'll have <i>much</i> higher capital costs up front and will be exposing yourself to <i>much</i> greater risk. Focus on your product and find a server solution that is cheap, low-risk, and flexible. Remember you can always scale later - but you have to have a reason to scale first! Have the faith to focus on product and don't fall into the trap of an 'intriguing' 'interesting' academic experiment in server setups! ",1176952570,,comment,,0.051,0.868,0.08,0.8892

They would not run into locking/contention issues as they scaled the way some other apps would if they used flat files and conventional locking.The database landscape was different in 1995.  There were no good free relational databases, and no cheap Oracle licenses.Lisp makes it very easy to write out any data structure.  (Most Scheme implementations can only write non-circular structures easily, but Viaweb used CL).  So if your app is amenable to using flat files, coding storage/retrieval is trivial.So basically, if you're writing an app with lots of separate datasets, flat files are a viable option.  If you're using Lisp, they're an easy option.  If it's 1995, they're a cheap option.

to me that is not very respectful. You dont really value him. I can see a big fight looming ahead.

On startup, the journal is played back, incrementally restoring the state.  Snapshots are taken periodically to keep the journal down to a manageable size.It's a form of the Command design pattern and has some nice properties.  You can get transparent thread synchronization by executing queries in parallel but serializing commands that modify state.  For web apps, the HTTP request offers a natural representation for commands (but of course you'd want to strip them down to their essence).  You can get fault-tolerance and scalability by feeding the command stream to replica servers.

Offer low, and make it sound like you don't really need the domain3. Try to convince him that you've gotten an offer from someone else, selling a better domain, in your price range.

The big fear I have is of people who don't want to hire employees that are smarter(broadest sense) than they are. One of the biggest benefits of working is the opportunity to work next to people you respect or enjoy. For ambitious, smart people also known as 'A Players', it's not easy to provide them with an environment where they will feel challenged and inspired by their team members. But doing so greatly increases the likelihood of winning those hires. Why do so many 'A Players' want to work for Google? I believe that it's because there's a sense that other smart people work there. You get a network effect happening in the HR side of things. Think of reasons for attending Stanford and Harvard, it's not really about the quality of what will be taught but the assumed quality of the others in attendance.

A Java IDE in a sense ""knows"" what you're writing and helps you avoid making mistakes while you're coding. People complain about too much boilerplate code in java - that's true, but it can actually be a good thing in the same way comments can be a good thing, and IDEs generate all the boilerplate for you with just a couple of keystrokes (whereas comments don't write themselves).I'm curious whether the Java bashers out there have ever used a good IDE like Eclipse or IDEA for any extended period of time. Because if you're using a text editor like emacs, programming in Java can seem ridiculously difficult.  Conversely it might seem ridiculously difficult for a person accustomed to an IDE to use a text editor for a scripting language.Coding Java without an IDE is like trying to control the space shuttle with a steering wheel.  Once you've mastered all the features of an IDE, however, (which can take years, but then again so does learning emacs) programming in Java becomes a breeze and you get all the benefits of static typing (with the safety and tools it enables) and the vast Java libraries with no extra difficulty coding compared to a simpler language.",1177013816,,comment,,0.115,0.744,0.141,0.8641

You just won't be on the news.Oh, and it gives you something to do--scaling it up and adding new features--after your initial launch.  While, if you spend all these years and all this VC money before you can launch, and nobody cares about your product when it's launched, you're probably going to abandon ship.  So, if you need VC money just to launch, you're nuts.",1177020567,,comment,,0.027,0.882,0.091,0.8765

They don't need to trust an opinion of an older editor.  The magazine cannot play music.  It's a pain to flip through magazines if you're left-handed.Do you really need a magazine to tell you, even if it's an accurate report, about the type of music people are listening to, when you can go and see what your friends are into, or see the top downloaded tracks in iTunes, and that's all that matters, really?",1177021732,,comment,,0.072,0.854,0.074,-0.0971

Similarly, the 500GB SATA drives are a much better deal than the 750+GB drives. Be careful when you spec. the boxes because if you don't specify that you're going to e.g., load them up with additional drives later, the builders will spec them with the smaller/cheapest controller they can.If all of the data can be handled locally then you definitely don't have a lot of data. :-).  To calibrate, we're (krugle.com) pushing around terabytes of data.  If you're pushing a lot of data between nodes, don't underestimate the importance of your network infrastructure and architecture. We're using multiple 1GigE NICs per node into Foundry SuperX's (IIRC, it has a 36Gbps fabric) and 10G crosses.

nostrademons,,,,14923,,14910.0,1525544185,,"Via Reddit.I submitted this because the incentives are very similar to those involved in startup equity, and the resulting proportions are roughly the same.  Startups must choose how to divide the pot (i.e. equity) with each new hire.  Each employee can then a.) accept the proportion, working hard to make the startup succeed or b.) reject it, slack off, and make them <i>all</i> walk the plank.  There's another complication in that a pirate's coworker may catch him at b.) and tattle, forcing him and just him to walk the plank.Why does this work like the pirate game, where only the senior pirate walks the plank?  Well, think about why the senior pirate ends up with all the loot.  It's because he's able to play the remaining pirates off each other: he can get away with offering 0 to pirate B, because he knows that B will be outvoted by the pirates that B is about to screw over.  Similarly, a shirking employee is ""outvoted"" by his peers in a startup, who stand to gain handsomely (even if the founders take the lion's share) if the startup succeeds.  They have a strong incentive to tattle on any shirker, which forces the shirker to work hard or get nothing.  0.1% of the company is a lot more than 0, even if the founder gets 50%.This game also explains a lot of other accumulated startup wisdom, such as:Why founders typically own 10-25% of the company each, while individual employees start at 1.5% of the company and decrease exponentially.  Each new employee has decreasingly less ability to make the whole company walk the plank, and so the founders can get away with giving up less equity.Why your first 10 employees are the most critical hires, and should be self-motivated hackers who want to see the startup succeed for its own sake.  At this point, the startup has little peer pressure: if the founders are off negotiating a business deal, there's nobody to tattle on the workers, so if the founders own 80% of the company and each worker owns 1%, there's a strong incentive for them to goof off en masse.  If, however, you have 10 people that don't care that the founders are making 10 times as much as them, then they will tattle on the next 10 hires that want to shirk, letting you give those hires very little equity.Why tolerating a single shirker often kills the whole startup.  Employees see that they will not lose their 0.1% if they shirk, and they figure that working hard so that the founders get 90% of the reward isn't worth it.Why big companies are incapable of getting anything done.  As the company grows and equity gets diluted, the options granted to any one employee become minuscule.  Thus, employees have more to gain by making friends with their fellow shirkers than turning them in and boosting the stock price, and a culture of mediocrity settles in.Why certain big companies have managed to avoid this.  There are two basic approaches, carrot and stick.  The ""stick"" approach is used by Intel and GE, and consists of firing the bottom 10% every year.  Employees figure that $60K salary is better than $0 salary, even if they aren't sharing in the company upside while the CEO makes $100M.  Unfortunately, this approach often means the company loses out on promising new hires who don't want to work in this environment.  The choice for them isn't $60K or $0, it's $60K and the constant threat of being fired or $55K and decent working conditions.The ""carrot"" approach is to give really generous cash bonuses for performance - often 2-3x the normal salary.  This is used by Nucor and Goldman Sachs.  Employees will not only work hard if it means the difference between $40K and $130K, but they're more likely to tattle on underperforming peers who bring their group productivity down.",1177038854,,comment,,0.048,0.867,0.085,0.9628

three.  They wanted to hire and made an offer -- a 20k pay cut, <i>but</i> they were going to
give me equity -- the magic word!  Except the president/founder of the company wanted to
keep 99%+ of the equity for himself, so anyone else let in on the deal had to share a
fraction of the remaining 1%.  I calculated that if the company was successful to the tune
of $10 million, my share would still be worth less than my initial pay cut.  I
pointed this out to the senior developer who was trying to convince me to join, but his
blind loyalty to the company seemed to preclude arithmetic.Prior to that I worked at another smallish company where the president/owner kept around
95% of the stock.  A few top people got 1% or less.  Other companies say they want to hire
""top talent"", but they pay ""market rates"" -- which usually means the average according to
some salary survey, or less, and no equity.It seems like some founders are so attached to ownership that they can't part with it, even
if it means greater success for themselves!  It's like they have visions of dollars from
owning the entire company instead of a vision of what's needed to get there.  While a
fraction of a percent of Google is worth a lot now, in order to get to that point, the
founders had to part with the majority of the equity.Some start-ups work with two founders, but some have half a dozen (like Excite) or more.

(it's a long story)Your standard RDBMS solution would probably involve the ircd logging directly or indirectly to a database, with a python script handling requests and doing selects out of that db.  On a network with thousands of users, this will load a db machine down with IO operations.  This also has to happen quickly, so that new text is added to the history log in near real-time.  Batching is probably out of the question.My solution was to have the ircd pass off its strings to another program (in this case, I used python) via a named pipe (this could also have been done via a socket, to aggregate multiple servers or do other neat tricks), and then have the logger app load these into memory - in this case, a giant python dictionary keyed on channel name which pointed to a constantly-updated ring buffer class for each channel.  This ring buffer held the last N lines of conversation.Writes were simple - h[c].write('text')Lookups were simple - h[c].get()Fast writes, fast reads, and disk i/o was batched for efficient logging to disk, at which point you deal with the data in batches and maybe store it into a db if you want to do something more advanced like with SQL.Of course this could all be done with C within the ircd itself as well, using a hash table and ring buffers as well.It was actually much faster (and logically simpler) than writing a DB solution, and I'm certainly no master hacker.",1177045493,,comment,,0.015,0.884,0.101,0.9769

gyro_robo,,,,14960,[15221],14852.0,1525544190,,"A great question.  I was watching a Charlie Rose interview with Peter Jackson from after
ROTK came out, before he won the various Oscars for it.  He said his big motivating factor
was fear -- fear that he'd wasted hundreds of millions of other people's money producing
the most dreadful movie(s) ever made.Being a big fan of the LOTR books myself, and feeling that the films' screenplays and
direction were both utter schlock, it occurred to me that this particular motivation may
not be conducive to doing your best work!  I was a fan of his previous films, which seemed
to be done for the love of it.We all try to gain pleasure and avoid pain.  Most of us will work harder to avoid pain,
though, making it probably the more powerful motivator.  However, letting it take too large
of a role in your life means your quality of life is negatively affected because of living
in constant fear.  It becomes a habit, which helpfully probably keeps you alive, but it
does this by making you extremely risk-averse which also precludes future success!  You may
not want to do anything new.One example of how letting pain-aversion become dominant affects you is that you may become
extremely lazy.  Let's say you've already got enough money that you don't have to do
anything.  Well, work requires effort, and effort requires energy expenditure, and that may
involve some pain!Of course previously you may have been excited to do the same kind of work, when doing it
was about gaining pleasure.  We tend to behave according to habits, and I would suggest
it's not good to let yourself accidentally become habituated to using fear as a
motivating factor, because it will creep into all facets of your life.So, very recently, I have consciously been trying to not react with fear and panic in
situations where I normally would.  There are so many situations that are really no big
deal, except for the mental model we use which we have trained ourselves to freak out over.I'm getting to think that the majority of our large-scale behavior is due to unconscious
decisions, and that we decide very little of importance consciously.  So, in order to
effect change, we may need to train and condition our unconscious via emotional responses.
Almost like Pavlov-dogging yourself, do multiple things you already <i>like</i> in conjunction
with some other behavior and you reinforce it: E.g. playing music and drinking Coke while
hanging out with friends at the same time you're coding will reinforce your love of coding.
Constantly think of negatives while coding and pretty soon you won't want to code on that
project anymore, and maybe at all for a while!I know this sounds cheap and gimmicky but I think it's very likely to be the case that our
strings are pulled by our unconscious.  See the
Precognitive Carousel: <a href=""http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1422464"">http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1422464</a>Also see this book on NLP (some of the formatting seems off from OCRing):

advertisers, religious and political leaders, and random authority figures will try to use
pain (mostly) and pleasure to get you to feel like behaving the way they want you to.I'm aghast when I realize how much of my childhood was actually a job as a field sales
representative for Mattel.  They recruited me via television cartoons (ads) to direct my
parents' income to their revenue stream, in exchange for various ""goods"" now seen only on
Robot Chicken.(World of Warcraft is the new Mattel, and they are Skinner-boxing away years of people's
lives.)By the same token, when you as a founder are rich enough to never have to work again to
maintain your previous standard of living, you'll find all sorts of expensive toys pushed
on you, playing on the same ingrained habits from your childhood.  You've been trained to
be fearful so that someone can sell you a temporary band-aid.  (There are evolutionary
reasons why it's easier to push people toward fearfulness and pessimism -- ice age
conditions were harsh!  The constant worriers didn't have much fun, but they stayed alive.
We're the descendants of people who got up and checked that the cave door was locked 57
times a night so sabretooth tigers didn't eat them.)TV advertising now has two main themes: 1. ""Look at these hot chicks -- now buy our
product!""  And 2. ""You're not buying our product?  No wonder hot chicks don't want you,
fatass.""  Survival is a given in our society so the next most monumental drive is
reproduction.  Watch how many people who want money from you try to play on this.  Don't be
manipulated into fearfulness and insecurity.If you're still young, try to be aware of when something is having an effect on how you
<i>feel</i> about something.  If you can see how your feelings are <i>starting</i> to change on
something, you may be able to counteract it before a pattern sets in.  If you're older, you
probably have to un-do a lot of stuff that's conditioned you without you even realizing it.

I like the idea of having a powerful datastore within the same process as the application because you don't have the IPC overhead. Although, if you're using prolog you're probably going to be less likely to want to do complex things in memory as you sometimes are with SQL.Some considerations that come to mind:
1) Relational databases bring a form of 'automatic' documentation to a project in that somebody who hasn't touched it before can expect to make a reasonable start on understanding it by using known tools to look at the schema.
2) You get powerful hot-patching tools with a relational database (sqlplus, psql, or similar) that have the safety of things like foreign key constraints.
3) Major version upgrades. As you're developing you can track db changes by writing change scripts. Then when you do your upgrade you can 'pull the lever'. There's nothing stopping you from doing this with any other structure, it's just something to think about.

Then you are on par with the founders.For interesting reading, look at Warren Buffett's philosophy on employee and management stock options.

I would be able to add ideas to my to-do list either by adding them to the calendar or by simply adding them with some priority (i.e. Immediate, High, Medium, Low).  Then, in my preferences, I would be able to assign priorities to items based on how many days away they are (i.e. 1, 5, 10, 11+).Finally, the point of all this would be to have a simple list of things I need to do, with highest priority items appearing on top.  Items without an explicit due date would gradually increase in priority based on some scoring system.  There would be a simple way to mark items off the list or to lower the priority.  I feel that this system would produce a nice mix of tasks that include items with a deadline and things that I would like to get done that don't necessarily have a deadline.The additional interesting part of the whole thing would be to allow other members to add items to your list.  You could have public items on your calendar (as with Google) which everyone could see, but you would also be able to have friends add things to your calendar, for example if they are planning a party and would like you to attend.  Now it would conveniently show up in your to-do list and you wouldn't forget about it.  Or if your wife wants you to clean the gutters sometime this week, she could just add it to your list with Medium priority, with the knowledge that it would gradually rise to the top of your list and you would get it done.Does anyone find this to be an interesting idea?  Is there anything out there that does this already?  As I said, I really feel like I could use something like this, so if it's already out there, I would be quite happy to use it.  If not, well, I guess it's something I should make :-).Thanks in advance for your comments.",1177088279,,comment,,0.026,0.825,0.149,0.997

That's a really hard market to design for.But, craigslist has shown that if you take a newspaper product and dump it onto the web with a perfect implementation (say what you will about craigslist and how ugly it is...but it's a beautifully functional ugly that's a joy to use), you'll get lots of users.  Every day there are thousands of obituaries published.  The paper gives you three or six or whatever lines for free, and you can pay for bigger ad-style layouts.  Just like classifieds being really cheap for a few lines, but getting more expensive the more copy you write, you can remove the expense of extra copy and adding pictures.So, taking something that's currently inconvenient (call the newspaper, spell the name three times, struggle with the family about who gets listed under ""survived by"", since you're running out of words, etc.) and making it convenient and free sounds like it'd be a winner.  It's the ""free"" part that makes it hard to make money on.  Who wants ads for home mortgages and crap all over their grandfather's obituary?

For us older guys, MSFT ate everyone alive during it's hayday - Borland, Novell, Quarterdeck, GEM, Amiga, and so on. It seemed that no one - not even IBM - could compete with MSFT and survive.Linux thrives and it's the younger generation of techies that have carried on this battle in an unstoppable fashion. Curiousity + frustration + dogged determinism has led to a people powered movement that could not be crushed by money, FUD or other corporate methods. Democracy and anarchism is the antidote to corporatism and fascism.

If you look at the memorial sites out there, they do cheapen it because they don't do a very good job. The concept really isn't about the creation of an online memorial. It's really about providing a way for the LIVING people to come together, remember and talk. What's important here is the process of remembering and sharing with the intention of creating a memorial. My idea is simply a way to foster that connection. I hope this frames it in a different light for you.

madanella,,,,15299,,15231.0,1525544243,,"Yeah. I just think about this every time a VC or some pundit says ""but it's just a feature"". I think it would be interesting to see a combination of these 'features' become a major player. The goal is to get acquired and have a relatively big payday. But I think it's possible that a group of small players could merge and grow big enough to go public and compete with the big players. Of course the biggest challenge would be deciding who was 'in charge'. If your company has 200,000 users and you can join forces with a few other similarly sized projects the new company would have more thinking and more manpower and resources and could benefit from some overlap in function and might be able to grow beyond some theshold that increases valuation multiples because of the viability of the company as an independent entity, and maybe even profitability. I think those things could very well outweigh the ease of fit of a feature. I'm sure it would depend on the buyers but it just might open doors to buyers that wouldn't be interested otherwise.

zaphod,,,,15302,,15186.0,1525544243,,"Being self-taught, I would suggest 3 things.  My first suggestion is to take a course in a programming langauge at a local college.  Learning a language, any language, will start you off faster than struggling with it on your own.  C# or VB.NET are non-intimidating and taught everywhere as they're the workhorse languages in many microsoft-based IT shops.   They're not cool and hackerish, but have the instant gratification of easy GUI building which is helpful to beginners, and you can avoid memory management which is very intimidating to beginners.  They're also taught EVERYWHERE so even in East Chucka, someone will have these courses in some format.  Appreciation for the finer things (ruby and dynamic languages) is more clear when you've seen how the other half lives.  Also, if you learn one of these languages, you can possibly get a QA or support job to pay for more classes.  Lisp, Ruby and and Scheme are cool, but won't pay the bills while you learn.The next thing I'd suggest is to come up with an idea for something you're passionate about creating, and learn the technologies you need to make it as you go.  Having a project you're excited about is the difference between being hungry for a technology and choking it down like a cold piece of liver.And finally, as the other posts mentioned, get the pragmatic programmers book when you're ready to learn ruby.  I'd suggest starting with a Ruby course, but I'm not sure they exist on any wide-scale.  Remember though, that book is focused on the framework, not the ruby language.  Once you know how to code, you'll be all set.

I learned today that Joe Hewitt is getting close to 30 (and he thought he was the oldest of the bunch before today).Also, Paul has mentioned several times in the past that the mean age of the companies they fund is climbing, and he's thinking 24-ish is the right age to start thinking seriously about a startup (finished school, had a real job for a while, so you know how much it sucks to work for someone else).Most of the founders who were in WFP2007 are hackers.  Some are more hackery than others (it's a quite wide range...some are famously good hackers, while others have only picked up a programming language, probably PHP, in the past year or two).  But, even the ones that aren't hackers by nature have become hackers, to some degree, during the program...in this early stage, it's the biggest part of the work that needs to be done.

There had been a lot of previous design work, but no implementation.  The plan had been to do a bunch of UI mockups, flesh out the design, write a business plan, and pitch it to a bunch of VCs.  When one of them gave us money, we'd hire a bunch of programmers and implement the darn thing.The first week after I joined, I started demoing.  It was really crude at first - just a login screen in a barebones layout.  (Heck, the product is still really crude - when we launch, it'll be yet another commodity CRUD-site, and it won't be until some months later that we'll have a useful differentiator.)  But it was <i>working code</i>, and it got better every week.The effect was pretty incredible.  The cofounder who was all pitch-to-VCs-and-hire-developers ended up learning Dreamweaver and coming up with a kickass layout.  And then he learned Flash and started out fleshing out large architectural areas, actually writing some Flash code.  We applied to YCombinator, got turned down, and decided we're gonna go for it anyway.Oftentimes, people just need to see that yes, this is possible, and that you can accomplish a significant amount on your own without waiting for a miracle to occur.I'm a big fan of the ""flywheel effect"" mentioned in Jim Collins's books.  It's basically ""Start doing the right thing anyway, no matter how useless it appears.  Keep doing it, no matter how useless it appears.  People will eventually realize that you're going to succeed anyway, and start pitching in.  Then the flywheel starts spinning faster.""  Many folks expect venture capital because they never hear about startups that succeeded without it; if you show them what's possible on your own, then you often get both the cofounder and the venture capital.",1177129767,,comment,,0.082,0.816,0.102,0.5366

You can't build an Office with AJAX. AJAX is too hard to program, relative to the functionality you get out of it. Heh, I am sure I will get a lot of smiles for this. The keyword is ""relative"". Btw, I have been doing AJAX in 2001, and it sucked big time.To build a WebOffice, you need something much more reliable, faster and powerful than the shitty JavaScript. A development environment with static compile time checking, better control of machine resources, faster. A FLASHy virtual machine for example.Google Apps (Sheets and Docs) are nothing more than toys, and they are locked in pit. They cannot grow larger than they currently are in an incremental manner.It is a pity Google did not snatch Macromedia, for lack of vision. Now Microsoft is building their own lightweight virtual machine, for exactly this purpose: deliver large scale apps to the web.b. .NET binding to the OS (the binding of Windows GUI to .NET 3.0). That's the single most aggresive move I have ever seen from a company. It goes like this: we are a monopolist of the OS market. Should you want to develop for our OS (which you must), you MUST use our developments tools and proprietary languages, which do not work on any other OSes. The monopoly is self-reinforcing, with one more leg added. The plan of the MS new boss is far-fetched (they mentioned 10 years), but it is sound.The seeds are in place and the wind is blowing Microsoft's way, just give them time to grow.So, I will start to respect Google's strategy the moment they push for the control of their underlying platform, making that little virtual machine.Regards,
Rares

bls,,,,15455,,15450.0,1525544266,,"I just started using GTD-like techniques. The basics of it are this: (1) write everything down as you think of it, so you don't forget anything. (2) very often, go through the list of random items; do the small (two minute) tasks immediately, and organize the rest of them into into (groups of) ""next actions."" (3) spend all the rest of your time eliminating items from the ""next actions"" list.I think it is effective. There were many times when I let a lot of email pile up in my inbox. Now, I very deliberately go through my email and respond to everything ASAP; everything that I can't do immediately gets filed away in a TODO list so I don't forget it. My inbox is thus ALWAYS empty. I don't know why but that makes me happy. It also makes other people happy because they are getting their responses faster. And, I get more done because having a list of ""the next thing I need to do"" makes me want to do things to get them off the list.The other thing I found to be helpful is to schedule all my distractions. Now, I have a reminder that tells me ""hey, check your email"" and even ""hey, check your feed reader."" This seems silly, but it is really helpful; I know that I will get the ""check your feed reader"" reminder soon, so I just keep working until it comes. Sometimes, I get annoyed and refuse (!) to check my email because I'm busy; in fact, I had started with scheduling them hourly but I am slowly reducing it down to three times per day. As a result, I check my email and weblogs WAY less frequently than I did before (even with an hourly reminder), because before I would check my email basically in between each item on my TODO list or even in the middle of something.",1177160007,,comment,,0.032,0.888,0.08,0.9357

I (along with approximately everyone here, so I'll spare them the effort of listing the obvious candidates) can list several popular ones off the top of my head that beat Google, in my opinion.  And not all of them are YCombinator startups either.  Hooray for diversity!GMail -- they aren't the only email provider, but certainly a leader.  You can't really go wrong with using it, unless you have major privacy concerns.  But then, why are you using email to begin with?Google Reader -- There used to be feeds.reddit.com, but now that I check it seems to have been taken down; what a shame.  I thought it was a really good idea, though it had been freaking slow when I last used it.  Using Firefox or Opera, there are already means to just integrate feed-reading into the browser.  I find that this has suffices.  It's no more or less centralized than opening a webpage to use a reader when you're already in your browser in the first place.Google Calendar -- kiko.com seems to still up and running, though of course they ran into trouble at the hands of Google Calendar.  Then there's <a href=""http://www.30boxes.com"">http://www.30boxes.com</a> among several others.Google Talk -- meebo.com doesn't suffer from problems he mentioned with Google Talk, so it actually beats Google in my opinion.  There are others, but they don't seem to be as good as meebo, in my opinion.Google Docs & Spreadsheets -- this is a tougher one when looking for actual online solutions, I think, just because the current online suites aren't as full-featured as the desktop equivalents.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_office_suites#Online_office_suites"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_office_suites#Online_office_suites</a> seems to be a good place to start, though.  Plus, I hear those zenter.com guys will be killing PowerPoint. ;)  If, however, you're looking for interoperability then OpenOffice.org works wonders.Google Page Creator -- not mentioned in the post, but weebly.com seems to excel in this field anyway, so they're (more than) worth a mention.Really, I think a lesson to be learned is that just as there are different apps you could use on the desktop, there are a lot of webapps to choose from.  I would think this would be particularly apparent as ubiquity in desktop applications seems to be flawed.  If it weren't, people would be more inclined to use pre-bundled software on Windows instead of OpenOffice, AbiWord, The GIMP, Pidgin (still have to get used to that), Trillian, Firefox, Thunderbird, Opera, and so on.  Moreover, if it weren't flawed then some webapps might not exist!  That, and the thinking that somehow there has to be an ultimatum between desktop & online applications seems fundamentally silly.  Not to say that what can be implemented in one can't be implemented in the other to some extent, but you don't need to have all of your applications be solely on one platform.  Freedom of choice and all that fun stuff.  Certainly the internet provides a platform that has several distinct advantages to the desktop, but that doesn't mean you absolutely must lock yourself into it; though, more likely than not, as webapps continue to become more advanced the preference shifts mostly towards them instead of the desktop.In the meantime, he and I are stating what most people should already know.

Simple answer: yes... build a matrix of friends/enemies/etc and iterate over it until you have absolute values ...'</i> Slashdot tried a model similar to this. The result you still got polarisation of views, short snipes without any real value.  I don't think it's simple. Why? You  can't change ""human behaviour"".  Anything you do there will be some person trying to find a loophole. Joshua Schachter (delicious fame) went into great lengths in his talk on itconversation about this.Especially just with an algorythm approach.  Though one thing I can think of that did more than anything for me was a points filter (meaning you can simply not view someones comments below a certain threshold ) . A more broader approach has better chances of encouraging (enforcing) good behaviour.One successful approach I have seen, can be found in the <i>perlmonks</i> (a perl programming) site where users gain karma through numerous means (time on the system, posts and moderation) enforced by a top down 'Benovolent dictatorship'  and in effect a hierarchy. You join the site as a novice & work your way up earning rights through encouraged & enforced behaviour. For instance you have to be a certain level (say level 5) before you can front-page a post. Another level and you can join groups effecting the design of the site.   This type of conditioning means for instance users don't have power beyond their maturity. If they do things <i>out-of-line</i> (say for instance random down-modding or excessive referencing) they can be pulled in before the inevitable <i>kitten fights</i> (al-la slashdot) begins.   In time, as a user reaches a certain level (of maturity) certain rights are allowed. So the combination of brute user moderation and a more subtle framework encourages finding solutions to problems rather than /. type brawls. I don't think mere code alone solves undesirable behaviour in systems. And it would be a good area for developers with a 'psychology', 'group dynamics' background to explore and add more knowledge.",1177219873,,comment,,0.028,0.811,0.161,0.9903

My only experience with game theory was a half-term graduate course and I don't follow everything you're saying, but my gut feeling is that these definitions aren't important to the spirit of the article.Suppose you're buying stocks; you choose a portfolio of stocks to maximize your return.  Of course you'll make mistakes and pick bad stocks, but as long as you have enough good stocks in your portfolio, you'll still turn a profit (and companies won't come and argue ""why didn't you buy my stock?""). The difference between YC and the stock market is that being chosen by YC can potentially increase your value; they are more like the coaches that train athletes.  So whatever portfolio they pick will actually end up with a higher value than if it were just left alone.  Also, it makes sense to evaluate people by things not so one-dimensional as ""ability"" (which by gyro_robo's argument we should maximize), otherwise we ignore other possible synergies between coach and trainee, such as similar personalities, that can cause the trainee to train more productively, independent of ability.The problem with the stock market analogy is that all you need to do is to beat the market, and to do that you just need to perform better than average.  Actually YC could do that if all they wanted was to make some money.  Perhaps similarly, a sports coach could be lax about picking athletes if the second-best team was way behind.  This is where I see the game theory coming in.  If there was another team, similar to YC, that was similar in performance, then YC would have more of an incentive to minimize the measurement error.  I'm not saying they don't already, I'm just saying it would make sense to do so.Anyway, I don't know if this makes any sense but the essay is fun and probably a good piece to show to some younger people.",1177227410,,comment,,0.068,0.802,0.13,0.9736

i haven't had any huge successes to show yet, and i really didn't want to launch like this. i had big plans of launching with my own money, and then i'd have prepared some nice texts telling my success story.as things went, we are launching early. i'm certainly in a different league than pg, but i try. being where i am now, i'll also write down some more information about me and the other people involved, so that you can get a better idea.basically i'm a computer security guy. started programming with 8, and then later spent a lot of time at university to get cheap net access using the DLX single-floppy linux distro that my brothers had developed in 96 (of course i had no student account at 14). met cool people there, tutors and such, and was trying hard to keep up with them. i started the teso security group in 98, and have been a computer security person ever since. i got involved with many NGOs, am really interested in game theory and reputation systems, co-wrote a paper on quantum cryptography, and started a company first trying to do social sorting, but ran out of money quickly (i wasn't checking against my own reality, but the reality i knew from my friends in SF, and expecting to get VC easily, so i rented an office, got myself a friend as a CEO who was good with words - i certainly wasn't back then). then i developed a bootable usb stick with a crypto IFS filesystem driver for windows, and loopback-aes for linux, to sell to local banks. we had a customer, and we finished the code, but my ceo got lovesick and didn't answer my calls for weeks. then i got a loan, hired a project manager to do this stuff for me. we didn't get anywhere, but she was really expensive. in early 2004  i had to close shop because we could neither get any funding at all, nor get anyone to manufacture the product. i made lots of mistakes. i got back into security consulting, and spent the last 3 years paying off my debt, and learning from these mistakes. i never managed to incorporate beyond my one-person-company. i spent my free time during the last 3 years building up the metalab, probably the most active non-profit and self-funded project center in europe. We have about 110 members, who pay 20 euros a month to finance our location. We are completely nonprofit and independent, and will remain like that. But one of the goals of the lab was to prepare both for my own next startup, and the startups of other people. so far we've been quite successful at sharing knowledge, experience, and instantiating projects. being wary of big endeavours with too many unknown factors, i'm organizing a computer security conference (<a href=""http://deepsec.net/)"">http://deepsec.net/)</a> right now and had planned to use that money to finance yeurope in a year. my startup probably is the most risk-averse of all we have in the lab right now. i was urgently aiming for success and start cash for yeurope. half a week ago, because we started lobbying as IG Startup (interest group of startup founders), an opportunity has arisen to do YEurope right now, by taking an angel on board. we certainly have worse cards than YC in the US, but i'm confident we can do this, or i wouldn't try.i'll try to write these things down in a more readable fashion in the future. in the meanwhile you can read a slightly outdated but less prosaic CV here: <a href=""http://kybkreis.org/~enki/cv_paulboehm2007.pdf"">http://kybkreis.org/~enki/cv_paulboehm2007.pdf</a>regarding the incorporation question: we have a harmonization regulation in the EU which allows us to start companies anywhere in Europe. we could start cheap LLCs or LLPs in the UK and still use them in Vienna, with Viennese law applying to all business except shareholder disputes which would be under UK law. for non-EU citizens we might have to find special arrangements. i have no idea how this might work. i'm not a lawyer though, and i'll leave this stuff to our lawyers.",1177237881,,comment,,0.041,0.823,0.136,0.9973

So, even your aunts diner that is opening soon is a startup.But when we talk about a ""startup"" here generally we're talking about a technology startup, or mroe specifically, a web oriented technology startup.But we're not necessarily talking about: Funding, organization, theoretical growth rates, etc, for that company.So, I think the term ""lifestyle business"" should be banned or rejected by this community.  Its a derogatory term used to apply to people who are chosing to go a different path, with the implicit assumption that that path is lame (eg: low growth, low chance of getting rich.) There are certainly a lot of choices that founders have to make with regards to whether they are building a real business or not (EG: something sustainable that will make them rich even if a $10B+ company doesn't buy them in 24 months... rather than something that's a feature built to flip to someone with a real product offering.) ... and funding, location, team size, team composition (eg: when to hire marketing or sales people), etc are all independant of whether you're building a business.You could bootstrap a company built to flip, or you could use VC money to do it.  You can use VC money to build a real business, or you can bootstrap a real business.But I believe, strongly, that building a real business is the only way to go-- its the most likely path to getting flipped, and its the way you will end up with something more than an adrenaline hangover after 24 months. I hope this is making sense... In summary, focusing on the business is the path to success... and recognizing all of these choices (including who to take money from) have advantages and disadvantages for the business case.  For instance, one option might make great short term financial sense but be damaging in the long term-- if its a build to flip situation then you don't care about the long term.  But in making that choice, you're risking the flip taking longer than expected....So, build a business.PS-- Justification for this long post: I was recently talking to a startup, and they are totally focused on being acquired within the next 18 months.  Thats their plan.  Their only plan.  Every decision they make is with that assumption, and they are going to be in a world of pain 24 months from now if they aren't acquired in that time period.  Worse, I think that if the followed a the right strategy, between 18 and 48 months from now they'd grow from a $250M business to a $4B business.",1177240213,,comment,,0.072,0.882,0.046,-0.9232

I knew him as a psych major who was a bit of an electronics whiz - I had no idea that he wanted to go into entrepreneurship or the Internet space.

Electricity researchers work on cutting the cordBy Dean TakahashiMercury NewsArticle Launched: 04/19/2007 07:12:46 PM PDT-----------------------------------------Who ever heard of wireless electricity? Seems impossible.I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen a demo myself at PowerBeam, a Sunnyvale start-up. The technology they showed off makes me believe that big, revolutionary ideas are still possible in Silicon Valley - even after decades of innovation. Don't close down the patent office yet.PowerBeam co-founders David Graham and Xiaobing Luo showed me how they could power up a little toy with a spinning fan without using either batteries or a wired power source. They can do so with an invention that seems suspiciously simple.They pointed a laser beam at a solar cell. The solar cell collects the light energy from the laser and converts it into electricity. Light in, electricity out.Then the electricity travels from the solar cell into the device. They call it an ""optical power beam.""It's the same principle that powers your pocket calculator with a solar cell. But in this case, PowerBeam gets a lot more electrical power from a laser as far away as 65 feet.In a patent application, PowerBeam says it can produce much more electrical power than other methods because it has tamed a dangerous laser. It uses a powerful laser of the sort that could cut through your hand, but it has integrated a safety system, allowing it to channel a lot of energy into the solar cell.I can't be a good judge about the PowerBeam technology (other than vouching that the demo worked). But I love the vision. I believe

that someone who pioneers this market will find a bonanza.Graham envisions someone using a laptop without plugging it in at all. You could, for instance, sit at a cafe or in the middle of a hotel ballroom and draw power from a light fixture above the center of the room. A laser atop the light fixture would seek out any solar receptor in the room with help from a detection system, such as a camera. When it finds it, the laser would concentrate its light beam on the laptop's solar cell.The size of the solar cells needed would vary based on how much power is needed. A cell phone could be charged with a solar cell the size of a silver dollar, says Graham. For a laptop, the cell would be bigger and be mounted as a pad on the laptop's cover. If PowerBeam systems improve and became popular, you wouldn't need batteries for your laptop as you travel.Another application is security cameras, which often need to be placed where it's not convenient to string an electrical cord. A security camera can run on just four watts, which Graham says his device can produce using a very small solar cell. Still another application is to use the PowerBeam system to connect high-end audio speakers anywhere in a room without having an unsightly electrical cord attached to it.It's a big dream for a little company. PowerBeam is just a two-person company in Sunnyvale's Plug and Play Tech Center, a building that houses scores of start-ups. The company still has perhaps two years or more before it gets a product on the market. But Graham says the company has filed for patents on the basic invention and is now talking to potential partners about applications.""We produce wireless electricity,"" Graham says. ""Think of us as PG&E. Our partners will do interesting things with it.""As for competition, it isn't hard to find patents for ""wireless electricity."" In the early 1900s, radio pioneer Nikola Tesla unsuccessfully tried to commercialize a wireless electricity invention. Many wireless power solutions aren't really useful because of problems relating to how much power they can transfer over distance.Last year, a research team headed by Marin Soljacic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said it could transfer electricity wirelessly using a concept called electromagnetic resonance. Powercast, a Pennsylvania start-up, says it has a safe wireless power system that uses radios to transmit power. The company says it will be used in lots of devices by the end of 2008. And another start-up, WildCharge, is preparing to start selling a pad that wirelessly charges cell phones that are placed on top of it.PowerBeam's Graham says his solution uniquely combines a powerful laser with a safety system.This isn't his first start-up. He sold a previous software company to National Semiconductor in 2003 for an undisclosed sum. After a year at National, he left to start something new. He dreamed up the PowerBeam idea about two years ago and later recruited Luo, a former National colleague who is an optical scientist.The two men were able to get a short-range demo working in December, and I saw it work across the width of a sizable room. The company is self-funded so far, but it plans to raise venture money. The solution eventually has to solve somebody's problem, and it has to be inexpensive.""About 10 percent of this is science,"" Graham says. ""The rest of it is engineering.""",1177273577,,comment,,0.034,0.879,0.088,0.9918

You have to be ready to switch business models.  Get users fired up.  Maybe even sell the company for $100,000 which Amazon offered and use the publicity with TechCrunch to start a new site, with his own statistics.So, although I think he's doing a good job getting Amazon some really bad publicity, even though this is a simple case of copyright violation which he is guilty of, he should be doing more than just ticking off Amazon.Instead of playing victim, he needs to get his toolbar out and compete with Alexa.  Don't just say, their service sucks I'm going to copy it, but say, the service sucks, I'm going to replace it altogether.  Amazon can't touch him with copyright suits.  This is basically extortion at this point.   Why?There is NO WAY he could have thought that Amazon (or any other corporation) would not be ticked off at him at some point on the first day he started doing this.  In other words, he's moved onto ""legal"" extortion--trying to make the company he's copying to pay him more than $100,000 or else he will make them look like they are the evil ones.  Had he sold his company and started his own stats company, fine.  But since he doesn't know when to stop, this is getting ridiculous.Finally, the fact that this is Amazon should not matter.  Everybody who develops IP (basically, everybody reading this) wants to be able to protect it.  I don't care if it's Amazon or Microsoft or Google.  Amazon didn't do anything wrong, and I don't agree that it should be spun that way.  As far as their 1-click patent goes, there was nothing like it on the web OR real life until Amazon invented it.

It will work with almost everything -- sendmail and postfix at least, so I'd bet that it works with qmail too.According to what Adam says he found, you have to be registered with some sort of clearing house or all the webmail providers will drop you as spam. This is not senderid or spf. The only efficient way to be 'registered' is to purchase and appliance from a company for upwards of $80K. I think this includes configuring it with your domain info as well.I wish my 'info' was not so vague. It comes from 1+ years ago, and Adam was never super-clear about specifics. It always sounded a little weird to me, but OTOH I do believe the webmail providers would do this. Apparently, it's done in the name of anti-spam, but the spammers are allowed to buy these appliances, so it's really about milking more money from emailers, and maybe about squeezing out the little guy.I'm hoping someone out there can clear some of this up, because it's a problem we all potentially face (if it's real).",1177337299,,comment,,0.092,0.846,0.063,-0.8172

danteembermage,,,,16017,,15988.0,1525544349,,"It was actually very easy to justify the valuations of many (but not all) internet companies in the first ""bubble"" although not by naive net present value calculations. The key is to model scaling up as a call option on a future larger version of the firm; you only get the larger version if your company ends up valuable. With a standard checking account type model the only ways to increase value are to increase cash flows or decrease your discount rate, but with an option other avenues become available.   For example, the lower the strike price of the option, the more valuable. So Webvan = enormous initial outlay = high strike price = bad, whereas two college kids in the Yscraper = low strike = good. Another way to increase the value of an option, and I think this is the critical one for the first boom, is to increase the uncertainty of the value of the underlying asset i.e. the hypothetical larger version of the company. In the boom, that uncertainty was huge, we will all be buying pet food online next year, will Google manage all commerce of any kind in five, etc.   So, interestingly, the very fact the wisdom of the crowd had no clue what Web 1.0 business should be worth may have driven the high valuations in the first place.   In the second boom it appears 1. Strikes are lower, 2. Uncertainty is lower = affect on valuations is ambiguous. That's basically the conclusion of article as well as I see it, just approached from a different viewpoint.",1177345500,,comment,,0.125,0.693,0.182,0.95

BrandonM,,,,16025,[16047],15938.0,1525544350,,"Yes, I agree that these types of tutorials can be useful, and they should probably exist in some kind of ""tutorial repository"" associated with different languages.  If that was the intention of the person who wrote it, then their time was time well spent in terms of how much they might help others.Part of the feeling I get out of these submissions, though, is ""Hey, our platform is just as good as RoR/Arc/x because we can do what they did <i>this</i> easily.""  I was trying to point out that such activities are not really accurate depictions of how good a given platform is, because much of what makes a language or platform good is being able to ""think in the language"", to develop your design and ideas as you go.  Once you have a solid design in mind, you could use just about any language to implement it.That's why I thought it would be more interesting for someone to develop something new using a given platform, and show the kind of work that gets done that way.  For example, pg often writes about how good Lisp is for writing programs when you're not sure of exactly what you want to do yet.  It would be intriguing to see someone use a similar approach with their platform of choice, recording the process, in order to show how flexible it is and what kinds of issues come up from the very start.  For example, how much re-writing occurs when a very small change is made?  Does the platform provide enough abstraction capabilities to make the underlying implementation transparent?As I've been reading On Lisp lately, I'm finally starting to get why pg likes Lisp so much.  There's just something cool about being able to write macro-defining-macro-defining macros, and it turns out that it can make the development process much more liquid.  Do these platforms (like PHP) support similar levels of abstraction?  Judging from ""For example, to display the time elapsed since a site was added, you could use: $time->relativeTime($site['Site']['created']), now that is awesome!"" I think not, because there are definitely implementation-specific details there that hamper flexibility and would be better off being abstracted away somehow.",1177347746,,comment,,0.005,0.863,0.132,0.9915

SwellJoe,,,,16093,,16038.0,1525544360,,"You're over-estimating how much time they can spend on each of the written applications.  There were hundreds.I was impressed to learn that Paul personally speaks to each group that makes it to the interview, but is not accepted into the program.  He does just what you're asking: explains why the group wasn't chosen and what they can do to improve the odds in the future or with other investors.And, as another response to your post mentioned, there is no benefit to YC to enabling groups to game the application process.  Everything, everything, everything you need to know about the process has been documented by Paul and many of the groups who've been through it (both accepted and declined).But I'll sum up:Build something people want.  You need to prove you're building something people want.  A ""proxy for demand"" is necessary if you're inventing something new, or evidence that users want what you're building rather than your competition if it already exists.Be capable of building what you say you want to build.  Link to a website or product that's in progress, or at least a website or product that you've built in the past.  I get the impression from my brief exposure to the process that one of the more frustrating things for YC is seeing a smart group with a good idea, but without the obvious ability to execute.  This is why they've discontinued requiring an ""idea"" on the application.  Just prove that you and your team can build great things.  If you don't have that evidence...why would they choose you when there are dozens of groups that do have evidence of building great things.  This isn't school where each project stands alone.  Show them your track record.  There's space for it on the application.That's pretty much it for the early process.  Then you've gotta pull off a demo for the interview day, and show extreme passion for building a business.  Very few no-demo groups make it into the program, and I believe the percentage is shrinking (and I suspect the ones that do get in without a demo have a long and fancy track record--I bet Zenter would have been in no matter what because they have a kick ass track record of building things people want, but they also had a killer demo that they'd built in the weeks prior to the interview).  It can be partly mocked up, or carefully orchestrated to avoid the bugs, but they'll see through wholly fictional demos so don't try to fool them--these aren't your typical non-technical investors.",1177358325,,comment,,0.083,0.792,0.125,0.957

We will get the customers to fill out surveys by rewarding them with frequent-flier miles. I remember three things about this company, years later: how nice their loft was, how stupid and convoluted their business model was, and how arrogant they seemed to be about it. They acted like they were already a success.In contrast, btw, the startup I did join was operating out of a cluttered office in Palo Alto that they'd got a really good deal on.

If your start-up feels like a grind then it's doomed.  Fortunately, you can re-program your emotional responses via various techniques.You pretty much want to do that regardless so that if you do strike it rich, you don't feel useless and indolent for the rest of your life afterward.  The continued success stories are the people who were REALLY into what they did.  For example, Bill Gates could have retired long ago; Michael Jordan didn't win one championship and decide that was all he wanted; Steve Jobs kept on going while Steve Wozniak checked out, relaxed, and got fat.

I'm hungry for #3, but there are other sources of information out there.  Get a few dozen people that are starting or have started companies together, and a few are bound to know the answer you're looking for.  I <i>can</i> do something about #4 and 5, and that's what inspired this site.This is basically a place for startup founders to show off their work, get quality feedback, and then release it for the world.  When you register your startup, you're randomly assigned to a group.  It tries to put startups in the same city together, though there's a random factor so you don't end up with 7 startups in one city and 1 by itself.  (In the future, I'd also like to add the ability to pick your group.)  If you have not launched yet, all your feature announcements - and the existence of your startup at all - will only be visible to your demo group.  Once you have launched, they become public for everyone to view, letting you gain some publicity.I was inspired by organizations such as the Grameen Bank and the Harry Potter fandom.  The Grameen Bank lends money to <i>groups</i> of people, never to individuals themselves.  This produces strong peer pressure to repay the loan.  Similarly, it's much more difficult to give up on the startup dream when you'll be letting down the 7 other startups in your group.  When I add karma, there'll be both a group component and an individual component, fostering a sort of ""coopetition"" between and within groups.As for Harry Potter - in fandom, there's a ""social price"" to membership.  You have to write fics.  When you join, people want to know what you've written, and they want you to comment on the stuff they've written.  Similarly, the hope is that the social price here will be that you keep pumping out features and gaining users.  The site is open to anyone actively involved in starting a startup: the one requirement is that you <i>do</i> things and don't just talk about them.There's a lot more I'd like to add to this site: karma and stats are high on my priority list, as is Markdown for comments and announcements, and it could use a bit of a UI makeover.  I'll try to keep up on feature requests and bugfixes, but I do have a day job, and this is a side-project aside from our main startup.  Please bear with us; this was done on a very tight timetable (2 weeks from rejection to site launch), and hasn't had too much testing.",1177396544,,comment,,0.031,0.862,0.106,0.992

surface, and instead just write into its cache, until
some later point when it's convenient to write the
surface. But the reason a DB issues a write to the
disk is that the DB needs the data to be recoverable
after a crash before the DB can proceed. So DBs cannot
easily use the disk's write-to-cache feature; the
disk's cache is no more durable than main memory.You might imagine that the disk would write-cache only
an amount of data that it could write to the surface
with the energy stored in its capacitors after it detected
a power failure. But this is not the way disks work.
Typical disk specs explicitly say that the contents
of the write-cache may be lost if the power fails.You may be thinking of ""tagged queuing"", in which the o/s
can issue concurrent operations to the disk, and the disk
chooses the order in which to apply them to the surface,
and tells the o/s as each completes so the DB knows
which transaction can now continue.
That's a good idea if there are concurrent transactions
and the DB is basically doing writes to random disk
positions. In the log-append case we're talking about,
tagged queuing is only going to make a difference if we
hand lots of appends to the disk at the same time. In
that specialized situation it's somewhat faster to  
issue a single big disk write. You need to defer

read say they may not copy the write-cache to the surface
during a power failure. I don't know about other drives, or
about why.Such a feature would anyway be hard or impossible to use as
part of a design to get fast writes and crash recovery.
Crash recovery usually depends on constraints on the
order writes were applied to the disk surface -- for
example that all the log blocks were on the surface
before any of the B-Tree blocks. Or (for FFS) that an
i-node initialization goes to the surface before the
new directory entry during a creat(). Drives that just
provide write caching don't guarantee any ordering
(much of the point of write-caching is to change
the order of writes), and don't tell the o/s
which writes have actually completed. So the
write-order invariants that crash recovery depends on
won't hold with write-caching. That's why tagged command
queuing is popular in high-end systems: TCQ lets the
drive re-order concurrent writes, but tells the o/s when
each completes, so for example a DB can wait for the
log writes to reach the surface before starting the
B-Tree writes.In our case, perhaps a pure log-structured DB could use
a disk write-cache. Crash recovery could scan the whole
disk (or some guess about the tail of the log) looking
for records that were written, and use the largest
complete prefix of the log. But we would not be able to
use the disk for anything with a more traditional crash
recovery design -- for example we probably could not
store our log in a file system! Perhaps we could tell the
disk to write-cache our data, but not the file system's
meta-data. On the other hand perhaps we'd want to write
the log to the raw disk anyway, since we don't want to be
slowed down by the file system adding block numbers to
the i-node whenever we append the log. ",1177408046,,comment,,0.073,0.896,0.031,-0.9034

As you mention, there's already Techstars, Highland, and YEurope for that, and any attempt to replicate YCombinator runs up against the fact that they're simply better at what they do.  Heck, even if this site was successful, I'd <i>still</i> probably prefer YC funding.However, YC doesn't scale.  So there are hundreds, probably thousands of other startups out there with worthy ideas that won't make the cut.  Simply because it's a numbers game.Some of those are going to start up anyway, and probably apply either to a later YC round or to local angels.  That's our plan, for our ""real"" startup.  But many more of them will give up because they think nobody's watching and nobody cares.  I don't think that's a reflection on their character, I think it's the rational thing to do.  Thing is, everybody loses out because those startups don't get started.So the goal here is to provide an environment where the 90% of us who <i>don't</i> get YC/Techstars/YEurope funding continue with our startups, and have something we can show local angel groups.  As I understand it, the main problem facing angels is they're afraid founders will give up and send the angel's money down the tubes.

erdos2,,,,16370,,16006.0,1525544400,,"I'd recommend reading Knuth's TAOCP. Example: Knuth introduces the Grey code permutation of the natural numbers in The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4 Fascicle 2, Generating All Tuples and Permutations (2005). Knuth gives the following equations defining Grey code sequences of length 2^n    G_0 = ()   [the empty list]    G_{n+1} = 0G_n 1G_n^Rwhere 0G_n means prepend 0 to everything in the list G_n,
and G_n^R means reverse the list G_n, and juxtaposition is concatenation of sequences. Successive elements of the list differ in precisely one bit position: this is obvious inductively, since if G_n does, so do 0G_n and 1G_n^R, and since the last element of G_n is the first element of G_n^R, the last element of 0G_n differs from the first element of 1G_n^R in the first digit. So this is a Grey code. 
We getG_0 = ()G_1 = (0 1)G_2 = (00 01 11 10)G_3 = (000 001 011 010 110 111 101 100)...
 The sequence of G_n's induces a map g:N-->N
recursively by    g(0) = 0    g(k) = 2^n + g(2^n -1 - r)    for k = 2^n + r with 0&le;r&lt;2^n, Here's an algorithm in Lisp for the function g.The function MSB below kills off everything but the high-order bit of the binary representation of a non-negative integer.(DEFUN MSB (n)
   
   (LET (( x (LOGAND (- n 1 ) n)))
   
     (COND ((EQUAL x 0) n)
   
        (T (MSB x)))))The MSB can be used to compute the Grey permutation

If you're holding it upside down in your hand, the built-in orientation sensor would simply rotate the grid correctly.  The less thinking a user has to do, the better.In other words, it could actually work better than the treo (another phone with a touchscreen), which you definitely can't use to enter a new number blindfolded with its tiny keyboard.  And, you could hold the phone upside down and dial the same way, which no conventional phones let you do.  A voice announcing the keys is a great idea, as well, since most phones use tones for keypushes.This would be great in an additional way, because whenever somebody tells you a phone number, they can follow along.

Ask around your business community - you will quickly learn which lawyers you can trust as being more company/entrepeneur focused, and which ones will be good VC lawyers but too cozy with VC's for a smart entrepeneur to really trust. Doing VC deals on the investor side is a low-margin business given the severe downward fee pressure from the VC's - some firms stock up on VC deals and go for quantity over quality; others will do a VC deal <i>for the Company</i> but will generally only occasionally work with VC's. Also, many VC-back-pocket lawyers will sell themselves to you as having all the connections to the VC's and can get your company in front of all the big players, but that should be an alarm bell. There is a difference - ask around with people who have been there and whose opinion you value and trust, and you will find it.""<a href=""http://www.venturehacks.com/articles/term-sheet-hacks#lawyers"">http://www.venturehacks.com/articles/term-sheet-hacks#lawyers</a> :""Most law firms do a lot more business with VCs than they are likely to do with you.

As Paul hasn't talked about YEurope on friday, I guess some opportunities emerged from that first get togehter.I'm eagerly awaiting the next one the 5th of May. I left the last one after a great chat at about 3am (if I remember correctly).While I do understand why people don't like the YEurope copycat from YCombinator, I think the reasons why they did it is obvious: attention and getting the message out fast. Most people interested in startups know about YCombinator and most of them will asume YEurope is doing something similar.
(time might also have played a factor)I personally know Paul and if you have a look at Metalab and on what he (and the others) achieved there, I think it's a good point to have some trust in YEurope.Many will agree that one of the great values of YCombinator are connections and bringing the right people together. That's exactly what the Metalab is trying to do and has done really well so far.(I first wrote that comment on TechCrunch and then copied it over here)

Almost every demand curve is downward sloping, yes, but that doesn't mean every demand curve is the same.If Joel's graph is accurate, and the Y axis starts at 0, this demand curve is VERY interesting.  It's one of the most elastic curves I've seen.  A 15% drop in price from 65 pounds to 55 leads to a 500% increase in volume.  Of course the data isn't perfect, this is assuming consumers will purchase at the same rates as businesses.  If Joel wants to maximize profit, where profit = (Price-Marginal Cost) x Volume - Fixed costs, then the ideal price should be around 55 pounds.This makes sense.  For software development firms, cheaper is usually better.  If you can reduce your price by X%, and increase your volume by more than X%, then go for it. You want to do this because software firms almost always have very low marginal costs (bandwidth), and very high fixed costs (development).",1177506471,,comment,,0.071,0.756,0.172,0.9684

If you go over, you have some padding before it's necessary, and you can decide whether to give up on your original task and start the next item, or push through with it and postpone everything else.

The problem was, and always has been, that they couldn't and can't change their entrenched business model for a new one.  Typical to the Innovator's Dilemna, an entrenched organization cannot easily remodel its' business practices to meet new challenges.  IBM has, to some extent, but the premier example is, obviously, Apple. In the cases of IBM and Apple they had to undergo an almost complete demise of the company to fight their way to a new approach. I'm willing to bet that a similar situation will come about in the case of Microsoft.  The only question is will they (like the others I mentioned) be able to recover in time or will they be the Wang of this century?

The multicultural aspect is necessary now more than ever considering the global context in which technology is applicable.  It is these fringe elements who create startups.  Both Stanford and San Francisco provide that mix to the Bay area.  You could say that Iowa lacks this, as does most of the USA between NYC and SF.In Canada for instance, there is the right cultural mix, but a lack of intelligent capital.

Marketing and sales are REALLY tricky for technical people, who seem to believe that the market is somehow fair...that having a ""better"" product will naturally result in the customers abandoning the competition and running to your product.  Only in the idealist's world are buying decisions made based on features and benefits.  In many markets the users of a product or service ARE NOT the same people who make the decision whether to buy the product the product or service.  The users and the purchasers may have completely different interests. I learned this the VERY HARD  WAY starting a business...sometime better and faster doesn't matter when your competition has a prestigeous brand or the purchasing decision maker only cares about price (since the users are a different group...the purchasers don't really care about making the user's life better).I would actually separate the ""marketing"" hat from the ""sales"" hat.   Sales guys want a list of leads to call or visit. They seldom have ideas about how to generate leads. Sales guys can get the door slammed in their face or the phone hung up on them multiple times in a day without needing antidepressants.   Marketing people need to go to the therapist when someone hangs up on them but they can figure out how to get a list of the right people for your sales guy to call and they can figure out what word to spend your google adsense budget on.

Even now, the transaction costs associated with starting a Dutch BV are easily twice what you pay for an English Ltd., and reporting requirements are more complicated too. The Chamber of Commerce, a QUANGO that is supposed to advise new companies and which doubles as the registry of companies, likes to claim that a Ltd tends to have a harder time raising capital than a BV, presumably because it sounds weird and foreign; but I suspect that the fact that you pay a low fee to Companies House in London instead of a high fee to your local Chamber of Commerce is also part of the reason why they discourage jurisdiction shopping.

mmiller,,,,16930,,9770.0,1525544484,,"Your thesis is based on the idea that Microsoft is dead because nobody fears them anymore. I think this is the wrong way to look at it. Does fear = relevance? It can, but how many people fear IBM? I doubt many. IBM is not dead. It's come back from the ashes of the late 1980s. They used to be feared, but I don't think that's the case anymore. Probably the only company that does fear them is Sun.I think one reason people are less afraid of Microsoft is they're doing things that are less scary. I agree with one commenter that customers might fear them more than entreprenuers do. They're gradually making their client technologies more cross-platform, not Windows specific. Customer requests were probably a big part of that, but it may reflect a change of consciousness on the part of Microsoft's workforce, too.I think Microsoft will remain relevant, just less scary.I think Google's gotten a little scary with the deal they made to censor search results in China. They found an exception to their ""don't be evil"" motto.

If so, I could use some help.  I am actually interested in ultimately duplicating _and open sourcing_ a lot of the functionality of Google generally, in order to decentralize it (the operation and its power, which after all is only algorithms + horsepower) and nullify the negative privacy implications of Google.  What do you think?  Any takers? I think the only possible contender to Google is an open source alternative. Let's Open Source Google!PS From another news.YC article: ""In Silicon Valley, Google-as-the-giant talk is deafening.

nostrademons,,,,17104,,16899.0,1525544510,,"I remember that essay, and my employer works a little like that (we have a platform that all of our products are built upon).  IMHO, it doesn't work quite as well as it sounds like it should.Problem is, information is lost every time someone communicates their needs.  Customers don't actually need what they <i>say</i> they need; there's always some detail that they forgot to mention that only shows up when you watch them use the product.  That usually changes the tools that the programmers need, which often aren't the tools the programmers say they need, because programmers have their own preconceptions about how the solution should be implemented.  Someone who's only done JavaEE programming will likely say ""I need a tool that automates maintanance of my Hibernate and Spring configuration files"", when they really mean ""I need to store my user's session data between sessions.""There's often a strong organizational pressure to use the output of the toolmakers, even if the tools aren't suitable for the job.  In my case, I'm not sure that I'd use our platform if just given our customer's requirements and my choice of toolset.  But I can't really say that, because it harms morale and makes me seem like a lone wolf who can't work with other people.  (Okay, I <i>have</i> said that, with the expected result.)The nice thing about research labs is that nobody expects them to be useful.  Other programmers can pick up or drop their work based on whether it actually <i>is</i> useful, not by some corporate policy.  Unfortunately, the people most likely to pick up an interesting research lab project generally refuse to work for a big company.  So there's a long history of guys in garages ripping off the best ideas of corporate research departments, and eating the parent company in the process.If I were managing a large, cash-rich corporation, I'd have a small exclave a mile or so away from the main campus.  It would have two buildings: a top-notch research lab, and an incubator (and a shared cafeteria, of course).  The research lab would be staffed with high-priced Ph.Ds and tenured professors, the best in their fields.  The incubator would be full of high school dropouts on grad student salaries, but with $40M+ stock grants contingent upon building something that millions of people will use.  All executives from the parent company would be prohibited from setting foot on this campus.Come to think of it, this sounds a lot like grad school, but without the bullshit.",1177611886,,comment,,0.031,0.89,0.079,0.9516

chmike,,,,17369,,16972.0,1525544549,,"I'am interrested in this story because I might find my self in the same situation. Here is the strategy I applied so far. 1. Keep key aspects secret. One always has to release some info, at least to get some feedback on the pertinence of the general idea or when we sell it. But keep some trump cards hidden in your pocket. This is often related to the 'how' aspect of the idea where you could make a difference with a ""stealer"". 2. Proceed in a way allowing you to prove that you shared the idea with X or Y. This is one of the purpose of an NDA (non disclosure agreement). If you can proove that, then you have a leverage on the stealer's investors because you may publish it and it will call back into question their honnesty and fairness. If they ripped you, they could rip clients. This is why public opinion frowns uppon stealing ideas even if it's not illegal. 3. If option 2 is not possible, then another leverage you have is that you can publish the idea and put the investors at risk to face many competitors and eventually freeware versions of it in a very short time. This is even more effective if the product is not out yet.
Be aware that you represent a direct threat to investment when comming up with such kind claim and want to use these leverages. So prepare your negation before using those leverages. This means that directly after presenting the problem to the investors, present the different options you have at hand. First present the options that would require some sort of cooperation from their side, second the only options left to you if they refuse (the one I presented above) and third that you are open to any other options that they may want to suggest and that would respect everybody's interrests. Be aware that there are things that can't be undone and also that it is better to have half of something than all of nothing. You can remind this rule while argumenting your cause, but keep in mind that it applies to you too. So be ready to accept an arrangement if possible. Keep a very open mind about the options you will consider. For instance you could ask them to invest in another idea you might have, but be very carefull to not blackmail them into that.  Just say that this would be an acceptable outcome for you if they agree to it and that you would then drop the case because you don't bite the hand that feeds you. Of course this suppose you have a valid alternate idea to show them when you say that. But be carefull with this because VC can easily get you out of your founded business if they want to. What you have to sell to VC is your capacity to create value by your inspiration or vision. This is what they are looking for.

 owner of one or more of them. If you are interested in 
 selling, please reply back with domain name and the price

 Thanks for your numerous replies. I guess my expectations
 are unrealistic because I didn't want to pay more than $100
 for this project. I am not interested in the other 
 variations (.net, .org, etc.) you offered me. Please let me
 know if you will accept $100 for just .com.

 Sorry, $ is too much for me. I will pay $200 if you throw
 in the other variations too. I want to finish this up soon
 so please reply back with the payment/escrow information.

They were ordinary musicians, but we loved their music. We did not tip more than a euro or two.
But listened and chatted with them, took their photos, and could not understand why everybody simply ignored them as pests.One time it was a poor man playing the trombone skillfully, another time it was a woman violinist (a student), another time a poor man on an accordion.About as many people passed by and everyone behaved, in fact, worse than the article. No one stopped to listen, nobody even tipped one euro.So you see, it was not simply ignorant, right-wing Washington DC, but in one of the fasionable, snooty art capitals of the world that this happened.

(Perhaps less clunky than using your phone's web browser to go to paypal.com.)  However, sending and receiving text messages is not exactly rocket science and the barrier there is really in handling the money and dealing with the applicable regulations, then having a large enough network to be useful.  Paypal already has the hard part done, and I can think of numerous reasons to add SMS capability in-house instead, but eBay has so much cash they might just decide to acquire you.

Or the shape that something you see is a bicycle vs. a car. etc.  Perception is in fact the most objective faculty we have - our direct connection to the real world.Now to say that our prior thinking can change our perception, I disagree.  I think that people can actively evade perceptions they have by trying hard to ignore them, especially those perceptions that indicate that an idea held by the perceiver is incorrect in spite of the emotional need of the perceiver to continue to hold the incorrect idea.You say that <i>As far as you can tell, that frame is reality. </i>   Clearly, a mental model is not reality, it is a model of reality.  If your theory were true, we probably couldn't even participate on this forum as our differently modeled realities wouldn't allow a common language that so relies on commonalities of perception and concept formation.But I agree with your actual point that it is important to associate with people who share similar views about the world, people who have a similar sense of life.  It can be very destructive to a person's view of what is possible in the world if everyone they spend time with is pessimistic and skeptical. When I was in Architecture school, all of my professors tried to convince us students that there were no new ideas, everything had been done.  That nothing great was created/designed/invented by individuals,  it was all thanks to groups.  That the heroic in architecture was impossible and undesirable.  That Wright's Falling water was banal, just a bunch of concrete plates stacked up above each other.  All of this foolishness was washed away when I worked for Paul Rudolph in NYC who single handedly was designing some of the most beautiful and heroic buildings I had ever seen.  The experience saved my world view of what is possible.  So my advice is to find the very best in whatever your field, and learn from it.  If you aren't able to do a startup on your own yet, find a startup that is the most innovative with the best ideas, and learn from them. Don't let the pessimists get you down, but stay grounded and realistic about the possibilities.  Too much optimism can be a bad thing as well, but keep in mind that great things are achievable.",1177766014,,comment,,0.118,0.74,0.143,0.9439

Koonji is an innovative experiment to redefine the way people access and use information.  The main objective is to make web research more meaningful by providing a complete solution to search, enhance, organize and share relevant online information. Koonji is a community-powered step-by-step how-to guide to do effective searches on the web. 
People often turn to the internet to find information and to seek advice typically starting with a search engine. But there is no way they can get organized information and a guide to trace the path for them. Koonji solves this problem by organizing information by breaking down topics into multiple steps and providing the best resources available along with helpful tips. The step-by-step guides can be on any topic from baking a cake to applying for a home loan. Koonji's content is all community driven, the guides or ""Koonji's"" are authored by users usually drawing from their experiences. Koonji believes that the community's collective experiences are the best place to generate information. Users find organizes information and are also aided by a companion Koonji toolbar travels with the users, allows users to tag and save information as a Koonji. Whether one is looking to learn how to buy a HDTV, how to organize a birthday party, how to find a job or how to plan a vacationÃÂÃÂthe process for completing these activities can be time consuming and frustrating. Koonji users benefit from the discoveries know-how of others, avoid time consuming web searches and any the trial and error method of finding information.  Koonji.com is information by users and for users seeking information.Please do contact me should you have any queries at steve@koonji.com .Warm Regards,Team Koonji   -----------",1177768228,,comment,,0.041,0.843,0.116,0.9722

Locally, and currently, Flex applications can open files for parsing, but can not write to them. This is remedied with Apollo which is in alpha. Apollo is essentially a Flex application wrapper that provides a file system API, among other things.2) This really becomes a question of whether or not someone is inclined enough to write the necessary Actionscript 3 as it supports binary sockets and byte arrays currently. Someone has already created a ZIP library.3) Again, when Apollo launches, then yes. Although, a Flex application can run offline should it not require file system access, and even then files can be opened, just not written to.Actionscript runs in a VM just as Java does, which is irrelevant given that the questions you're asking are entirely arbitrary.

Difficult, and very stressful, but possible.When I was first asked to co-found my startup, I immediately became very unhappy at work.  It was just too much cognitive dissonance.  Once I had a startup (which had been my life's goal all along), why waste 8 hours a day working for somebody else, where I'm so much less productive?Over time, I adjusted.  I just saw work as having one set of rules and expectations, and startup as having another set of rules and expectations.  So I gave up trying to introduce more productive technologies at work, because it wasn't going to happen anyway.  And I adjusted my expectations for productivity downwards, because hey, my boss doesn't know that you can do better than JavaEE levels anyway.End result: I'm much happier at work, which is <i>perceived</i> as being more productive because most people judge based on attitude instead of results.  And then I go home and do everything my boss tells me not to on my startup.  Only downside is that my startup may launch before my project at work does, which renders moot one of my main reasons for keeping the day job.It's similar to switching keyboard layouts.  When you first learn Dvorak, you <i>will</i> forget how to touch-type on Qwerty.  But if you keep typing on Qwerty, eventually they'll start separating in your mind.  For a long time, I would automatically type Qwerty whenever I saw a Gnome desktop and Dvorak when I saw Windows.  Then it further refined itself into typing Qwerty whenever I saw Netbeans and Dvorak whenever I saw AIM.  Now I'm basically fluent in both layouts, and can consciously switch between the two of them.Also, I suspect every startup founder will have to undergo another frame shift eventually: shifting from the general startup culture to <i>YOUR</i> startup culture.  Right now, most of us are internalizing the values of Startupping, News.YC, Ruby on Rails or Python, and various entrepreneurial blogs.  Eventually that'll have to shift to the cultural values of the particular startup that you found.  Any past or present YCombinator founders around to comment on this?

It should serve the interests of the busy start-uper and minimize the amount of time needed to get informed -- a chat room does not do this.
Additionally, chat room discussions are disorganized and difficult to properly archive. They represent a step back from threaded discussions; however, chat rooms offer real-time communication. That's their sole advantage.I think if that's what we as a community want, we should propose some features to accomplish those goals without losing the advantages of threaded, archived discussion. How about features like thread subscriptions, reply alerts, the ability to reply to a child comment via text message, thread organization tools (some distinction between link threads and discussion threads), etc...

You don't have to read.But if you do, thanks for your time.For a long time I thought I wanted to have my own business. I starter with  Import-export. That did not last a year and left me with more debt than what I make in 9 months. I am still paying for that matter fact. Then I thought I had a gift for seeing what will be a hot in technology. I remember talking to friends about web based word processors, mobile voip and niche social networks before this things were what they are today. But soon after I realized that most people thought of it too, but like me they did not do anything about it. I found myself running left and right, getting with developers and working on cool projects, only to abandon them and getting into something bigger. I am a Dreamer. I dream of products in the day and gather people to implement them by the evening. And that is it. After it is done I keep fwding the launch. I realized that I was not a business man. So why starting a startup?
Well I think  I want to be a Teacher, or a role model. I would like to build a successful startup, but I would love to sit on the other side of the table and listen someone who has nothing more than an idea and $1.75 to pay the bus fair to come talk about their idea. I think I would love to sit down in the coffee shop and get so excited about his/her idea that I can yell  ""You are a FUCKING Genius KId"". I think I would love to tell her/her to call someone who had something similar  and get with him/her to build their startup.I think I would love to be woken up by the same entrepreneurs at 3 AM, just because the servers are down and they are freaking out as users in Russia are assaulting them with emails. I think I would love to help him/her calm down and find a solution to the problem. I think I would love to relax sometime in my beach-side coffee shop and laugh with them about how 3 years ago they had only an idea, a passion and $1.75, and today the only think that worries them is ""how the HELL are they going to keep 1, 2, 3 millions users happy?""But before doing all that, I think I need to be in the same situation the kid is. I must start with nothing and build something. I must really be tired and know that the only thing that is keeping me up is Passion. I must be nervous at launch and wait for the first 1000 registered users. I would be a fool if i was to give advices to someone if I don't know how they feel at the time. The problem may be different, but the feeling is the same. Maybe you feel like me. Maybe you like to THINK and CREATE, but adore to SHARE. Maybe instead of sharing features like WEB2.0 standard, you want to share your experience and help someone else become successful. Maybe you just want to smile and tell the entrepreneur.

Anybody who has been exposed to most of the common ways of thinking about programming (functional, logic, the various subsets of OO, imperative) can probably pick up a language that uses any of those pretty easily (it's basically just syntax from there). Similarly, someone who knows both Chinese and English can probably pick up French pretty easily, because their tools for thinking about languages are expanded enough that picking up another one doesn't involve significant restructuring. However, if you take someone who programs in Basic, and try to teach them Lisp, it will take them a long time, because there are lots of new concepts to learn.

whacked_new,,,,17868,[17901],17738.0,1525544621,,"Valid point. But also look at it this way.An English speaker who has mastered Japanese will have gone from an SVO (subject verb object) language to an SOV language (Chinese is not as convenient an example, because it is also SVO). This is a completely different ""paradigm of thinking,"" just for the comparison. Your brain needs to sort the order of concepts before your initiate your utterance. You need to match particles to their respective concepts. For anybody who never learned such a system, it doesn't come easily. But those who have gone to a sufficient level will become more perceptive of the nuances and particulars of ""language"" as a whole. This knowledge is far less accessible to those who only know one language. A linguist who only speaks one language will not be taken seriously.Similarly, a competent programmer is likely to be versed in several languages, and likely they will fall into different paradigms. A programmer who only does LISP is likely to not have the same level of knowledge about the computer system than one who knows several languages. After all, you are looking at multiple ways of generating 1s and 0s. As such, knowing LISP certainly cannot imply anything. Of course, the author anticipated this response, and added a loophole in the article, which I consider a bit too wide, hence the criticism.There are visible reasons why LISP trains your thinking. My post above is pretty poorly written, but the reference to spaghetti code is like the BASIC example you mention. Supposedly, good programming practice discourages spaghetti code, and BASIC was taken as the bad example. But people think in spaghetti code. If you pry open von Neumann's brain, it would probably be uber-spaghetti code. It would probably decompile into something more BASIC-like than LISP-like, but he's insanely smart.Yes, it's the logic training. But if that was the theme, the article should have addressed it clearly.

By implement, I mean either have their engineers hack out, or buy.  To assume that they will buy it from you is foolish by the way.  I'm looking at you two GUBA and Revver, but I may as well be talking about every web 2.0 startup I've had the misfortune of having to look at in the past 12 months.Are there ANY original thinkers out there?  Where are you at?  Money is waiting for you.I would like, for once, for three kids to come up to me and say that they have World of Warcraft or Second Life running with full 3D hardware acceleration inside of the browser.  WITHOUT A GAD BLESSED PLUGIN OR SECURITY WARNING!!!  This would be something compelling that is difficult to implement.  It is also something that would take people more than 2 weeks to duplicate.Think of it this way, how many people get rich anymore by writing say, IDE's?  None, because we all use what Microsoft, Adobe, or Eclipse gives us, for FREE?  The same thing will happen very soon with social networking, it will be included with your hosting.  Probably by leveraging open source.  So everyone will be able to start a story telling site with photo uploading for illustration and social features.  However, I think it will be more difficult for someone to make a web based Joost with television recording and social features.  So if you can, your asking price just went WAY up kid.The things I have outlined are hard, and that is the point.  If I invest in something, I don't want to hear about 35 other startups doing the exact same thing.I'm not just talking about the web 2.0 people here.  You would not believe the number of 'Second Life' knockoffs that are about to hit the market.  They all expect that 3 to 30 million people will download and install their plugin, or click 'Yes' on their security warning.  You know, the one to give this startup you never heard of FULL access to your machine.  That's OK though they tell me, because they only need to get the early adopters to spread the word.  The TECH SAVVY early adopters.  Yeah, you heard me right, the ones MOST likely to know NOT to give a startup they've never heard of full access to their machines!If ANYONE can find a tech startup that doesn't infringe copyrights and actually has technology that would take a minute to develop, I think I would fall over from shock.Sorry about this rant.

I don't think it's true that competent programmers are likely to be ""competent"" in several languages that fall into different paradigms.Also, I feel like LISP's paradigm is so far removed from most others (and with arguably a superset of concepts), that any programmer who is competent in LISP <i>IS</i> likely to be competent is several other languages that span different paradigms.  Agreed if there exists one programmer out there who <i>ONLY</i> knows LISP, they lack the complete conceptual understanding I'm asserting.It seems to me that programmers who tend to write spaghetti code and/or over complicate matters will abandon LISP out of fustration before they achieve ""competency in LISP"".The point of the article was to assert that ""competency in LISP"" implies  much more than ""competency in LISP"" and that this statement is not true of most other programming languages.Sorry you feel this article propagated misconceptions, I'll try to do better next time.

That the controversy over switching from Lisp to Python was a ""turning point"" for Reddit's traffic.  Such a minor controversy wouldn't have generated sustained traffic.  And indeed when you look at Reddit's lifetime traffic graph, there aren't any visible inflection points; it is overall a pretty smooth upward curve.2. The reason Digg got more traffic was not some subtle difference in SEO strategies, but simply that (1) they started several months earlier, and (2) they promoted the site energetically to their enormous core audience of 15 year old gamers.3. The reason it seems from talking to the Reddit founders that ""success was not so difficult"" is that Steve and Alexis are such understated guys.  Simple design always looks like it was easy.

In some cases this will flat out be a condition of investment, so it is agreed on in advance. If you are really anxious to close the deal it is easy to see why you might agree.In other cases the composition of the board might be such that a majority might vote for a CEO change. This can be the case when, in addition to the founders and the VCs on the board, there are ""independent"" directors who might vote with the VCs. If the independents+VCs is greater than 50% of the board, they can usually make a change of CEO.If the VC does not have 50%, but no individual founder does either, it is possible for the VCs to convince some of the non-CEO founders that it would make sense to bring on ""professional"" management to increase the possibility of success. Particularly if the founders have some disagreements, this can be tempting.One other thing that can happen is that as a company goes out to pursue additional rounds of financing, the existing VCs can use that process as leverage to force a change. For example, if they say that they won't invest their pro-rata share in a new round, that can often be a warning sign to other investors. So, the VC might threaten to withhold that investment to convince the CEO to step down.Majority ownership means a lot, but it is not everything.",1177903273,,comment,,0.054,0.857,0.089,0.7532

Early Options
Tech entrepreneurs looking for seed money have more places to turn these days
By JACLYNE BADAL
April 30, 2007; Page R6The world of dot-com financing is changing, and entrepreneurs are reaping much of the benefit.While the competition for deals remains stiff, investors and researchers say tech entrepreneurs looking for seed money have more varied options these days. Indeed, some investor groups and venture-capital firms are giving companies that are still in the concept stage faster access to modest amounts of cash, and asking for less equity in return.Seed money -- used to turn an idea into reality -- is among the toughest financing to secure for tech-related start-ups. Banks and professional investors are frequently reluctant to jump in at such an early stage. The few entrepreneurs who manage to cut deals with venture-capital firms tend to give up huge chunks of equity, something a lot of founders want to avoid.Easier TermsBut with the new approach -- driven in part by the falling cost of launching Internet start-ups -- some venture capitalists and so-called angel investors are writing smaller checks and issuing them faster, in return for either relatively small stakes upfront, or convertible notes that can be turned into equity under certain future conditions.Angel investors -- wealthy individuals who fund companies and tend to take a hands-off approach to day-to-day management -- were the largest source of funding at the seed and start-up stages last year, backing roughly 23,500 such ventures, according to the University of New Hampshire's Center for Venture Research. Jeffrey Sohl, director of the center, estimates that roughly 35% of the $25.6 billion in angel investments last year went to early-stage companies.Dr. Sohl says some 46% of angel deals were at the seed or start-up stage, a proportion that the center expects could grow to as much as 55% in the next several years.Venture capitalists, meanwhile, invested in more than 300 seed and start-up deals in 2006, up from 184 such deals in 2005, the center says.""There's tons of money around, and if you can't find it, you're not ready to start a company,"" says Kenneth Morse, managing director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MIT Entrepreneurship Center.Tech Coast Angels Corp., a network of angel investors started in Irvine, Calif., recently launched a ""seed track"" funding program to get earlier access to companies. Candidates who look good on paper are invited to a screening session and have 30 minutes to sell their idea to about 10 angels, with half the time used to field questions. If investors are impressed, the entrepreneur can get a check the same night, or a few days later, in return for as much as 10% or so of the company, depending on valuation and check size.The Tech Coast network also offers more traditional funding for entrepreneurs, but that route, because it usually involves bigger investments, can require about 500 hours of due diligence.Checks for $25,000 to $100,000 in seed-track funding are common, says Tech Coast Angels founder Luis Villalobos. In some cases, the angels won't take equity upfront but will issue a convertible note, which would be turned into stock if the company later provided equity stakes in a formal funding round.Quick LoansOn the venture-capital side, QuickStart Seed Funding Program at Charles River Ventures LLC, Menlo Park, Calif., offers loans of as much as $250,000 at 6% interest and takes no equity upfront. If the start-up does well and sells to venture capitalists, the debt -- plus interest -- converts to stock at a discount of as much as 25%. (A $250,000 loan, with interest factored in, would be worth up to $353,333 in stock a year later.) Entrepreneurs should note, however, that the firm wants to be an equal investor in any future funding round, so it could ultimately end up with a more traditional venture-capital-size stake in a company -- say, 20% or more.Successful companies that never go for another round of funding but are bought out by another company, say, or go public, are expected to pay Charles River double the amount that they borrowed.A Seattle-based start-up, BuddyTV.com, a discussion forum for television fans that also features original interviews with TV stars, is one of the first companies to get funding under the Charles River program. BuddyTV Corp. Chief Executive Andrew Liu says the $250,000 check came just five to seven weeks after his first meeting with Charles River.The program was a ""great thing for us because we didn't spend much time on fund raising and could focus on the execution,"" Mr. Liu says. The debt is currently outstanding. Mr. Liu hopes to have positive cash flow before trying for more funding for his company.Seed-funding provider Y Combinator LLC, Mountain View, Calif., takes a slightly different approach. It gives out less cash than most seed-money investors -- a company with two founders gets a check for $15,000; one with three founders gets $20,000. But Y Combinator devotes more time to teaching young engineers with interesting ideas how to be entrepreneurs. About a dozen fledgling companies at a time attend 12-week programs in Mountain View or Cambridge, Mass., where experts speak at weekly dinners.Then, at week 10, the start-ups make presentations to potential additional investors, with the last session drawing about 60 outsiders. Y Combinator usually ends up with about a 6% stake, but the range can be from 1% to 10%, depending on the company's initial valuation.""It's much easier to get seed money than it used to be,"" says Paul Graham, a partner at Y Combinator. ""Ten years ago a bunch of college kids starting a start-up had to go on hands and knees.""But seed funding is still by no means easy money. Mr. Graham says this year's winter session in Mountain View had 200 to 250 applicants, with the program accepting 13.Charles River gets five to 10 submissions a day for its QuickStart program, but plans to fund only 10 start-ups this year, says George Zachary, a partner in the firm.""If it takes us more than five minutes to understand what the product is, we are not going to fund it,"" Mr. Zachary advises.Start-up hopefuls who don't get funding right away sometimes need to improvise until they do find capital. Some venture-capital firms, like Highland Capital Partners LLC in Lexington, Mass., will give free or reduced-rate office space to start-ups that they like but aren't ready to fund. This allows the start-up to work side-by-side with other entrepreneurs and investors. Almost the entire first floor of Highland's Lexington office is devoted to Highland-backed start-ups, says Highland Managing General Partner Paul Maeder.Technical HelpAlternatively, entrepreneurs can recruit engineers and other experts to the team in an effort to do as much as possible without outside investment.Daniel Marques couldn't get funding for his first Internet business, started as a freshman at Babson College, Babson Park, Mass. So he and his partner brought in a third person to help with the technical aspect. The trio kept expenses low and eventually gained positive cash flow and attracted an angel offer.Finding the first risk-taker can be difficult, says the 22-year-old Mr. Marques, ""but a lot of people want to be the second.""No matter how successful a start-up is at attracting capital, New Hampshire's Mr. Sohl advises researching the investor before accepting any of the money. Venture capitalists or angels with even a small chunk of equity can become a problem if their plans for the company differ from the founder's plans.Make sure your visions align, Dr. Sohl warns: ""Due diligence is a two-way street.""",1177945680,,comment,,0.026,0.88,0.094,0.9982

For the rest of us, hopefully those smart people turn into (or remain) researchers don't start churning out products.  Of course, that doesn't seem likely.It does seem like applying technology to social networking is becoming a commodity.  Not that there's not more to be done, but there are an aweful lot of me toos and simultaneously similar endeavors.  Darwin would be happy.I think the key to creating value it to look where other's aren't.  Once enough smart people and companies are working on a problem, the value you can create by following everyone else is much more deminished.  If all the great athletes were trying to become home run hitters, an up and coming athlete would have much better odds looking towards a slightly less popular sport in which to excel.I think there are too many people trying to hit home runs at social networking.  If you have a great (novel) idea, start swinging, if not, look for a different domain to create value, I think your odds will be better.I think you are right that 3D interfaces are coming up next, but I'm not sure your approach is correct.  As others have mentioned here, 3D in a browswer is probably not the way to go.  The Croquet Project (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquet_project)"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquet_project)</a> look like they are on to something... and it's free and open source (I wonder how that will effect all those ""about to launch"" companies you mention).  To have satisfactory 3D you want a local engine that works directly with the hardware (or such functionality integrated directly into the browser).  But you seem to be disappointed in these options.With regards to the low barrier to entry concern.  Yeah, I see the same thing which is what has stopped me working on a few of my ideas (a couple of times a decision I regret).  I think to a large extent this is due to the ever decreasing development times (open source and development efficiency), and more efficient sharing of ideas (blogs/tagging).  This seems to be a structural change that will only get worse.Original thinking definitely creates more value, but I'm not sure it's necessarily creates a higher barrier to entry.  While everyone else is running the marathon, take the short cut (look where they aren't).  It doesn't matter if you don't have a high barrier as long as you shock everyone with what you produce.
